In this post, I will introduce you to 10 macOS apps that will level up your Mac experience without draining your wallet.

*Let’s dive in!*

Shortwave comes with a built-in AI assistant that can write your emails (yes, it learns your style), pull up exactly what you need with just a quick search, and even summarize long emails for you so you don’t have to slog through them.

What I love the most about the app is that it turns emails into tasks and organizes them into bundles — perfect for someone like me who needs inbox zero to function. You can also schedule emails to pop up when you want to deal with them, not randomly.

For under $20, Shortwave is worth your money, and if you feel defeated by your inbox every day, you should check out the app.

## Texts — All Your Messaging Apps in One Place � �

If you are tired of jumping between a million messaging apps, Texts is the solution you didn’t know you needed. It pulls all your conversations — iMessage, WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Instagram, you name it — into one inbox so that you can chat without the app-hopping madness.

The best part is that all your messages in the Texts app are private (no server snooping). The app also throws in some AI magic with features like chat summaries, draft responses, and built-in translation, most of which are unavailable in individual messaging apps.

**Source**: Texts

You can even snooze messages or schedule them to be sent later, which is excellent if you get a lot of messages across the apps and have a lot of those awkward ‘too late to text’ moments. If you want to streamline your messaging without the chaos of dealing with a hundred different apps, paying $15 a month for a subscription to the Texts app is a no-brainer.
