# Development Log: Building a Production-Grade Article Reader with LLM Assistance

## Hallmarks of Production-Grade Code

Before diving into the development process, let's establish what we're aiming for in production-grade code:

1. **Reliability**

   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Graceful degradation
   - Input validation
   - Rate limiting and timeout handling

2. **Maintainability**

   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Consistent coding patterns
   - Self-documenting code
   - Meaningful commit history

3. **Testability**

   - High test coverage
   - Integration tests
   - Unit tests
   - Clear test patterns

4. **Observability**

   - Structured logging
   - Performance metrics
   - Error tracking
   - Health checks

5. **Security**
   - Input sanitization
   - Authentication/Authorization
   - Secure data handling
   - Dependency management

## Development Approach Log

### Day 1: Single-File Foundation

Starting with a "narrow but complete" approach rather than a massive initial prompt. This allows us to:

1. **Focus on Core Flow**

   - Single article fetching
   - Basic markdown conversion
   - Simple file storage
   - No premature abstractions

2. **LLM Interaction Strategy**

```gherkin
Human: Let's start with fetching a Medium article and converting it to markdown
LLM: *Provides basic single-file solution*
Human: Add error handling for network failures
LLM: *Enhances specific section with try/catch*
```

3. **Initial Testing Approach**

   - Manual testing of happy path
   - Document edge cases for later
   - Keep track of assumptions

### Day 2: Refactoring and Testing

Moving from working code to maintainable code:

1. **Function Extraction**
   ```typescript
   // Before: Monolithic processArticle
   // After: Focused functions with clear responsibilities
   async function fetchContent(url: string);
   function parseMetadata(html: string);
   function sanitizeContent(content: string);
   ```

````

2. **LLM Collaboration Pattern**

```shell
Human: How should we split this into testable functions?
LLM: _Suggests logical boundaries_
Human: Now help me write tests for the fetch function
LLM: _Provides test cases and mocking strategy_
````

3. **Test Evolution**
   - Added first unit tests
   - Introduced dependency injection
   - Created test utilities

### Day 3: Module Separation

Breaking into logical modules while maintaining simplicity:

1. **File Organization**

```
src/
├── fetchers/
│ └── medium.ts
├── markdown.ts
└── storage.ts
```

2. **LLM Guidance**

```
Human: What's the minimal module structure needed?
LLM: _Suggests focused files without over-engineering_
Human: How should these modules communicate?
LLM: _Provides interface definitions_
```

1. **Integration Development**
   - Added integration tests
   - Implemented error boundaries
   - Established logging patterns

## Key Learnings

1. **LLM Collaboration Best Practices**

   - Start small, expand gradually
   - Ask for specific enhancements
   - Use LLM for refactoring suggestions
   - Validate suggestions against best practices

2. **Development Flow Benefits**

   - Easier to catch design issues early
   - Natural evolution of architecture
   - Better understanding of each component
   - Clearer documentation path

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Tests grow with code complexity
   - Focus on critical paths first
   - Use LLM to suggest edge cases
   - Build test utilities incrementally

## Next Steps

1. **Code Quality**

   - Add linting rules
   - Implement code coverage tracking
   - Document API interfaces
   - Create contribution guidelines

2. **Feature Expansion**

   - Add support for more article sources
   - Implement caching layer
   - Add rate limiting
   - Create CLI interface

3. **Production Readiness**
   - Add monitoring
   - Implement proper logging
   - Create deployment pipeline
   - Document operation procedures

This iterative approach with LLM assistance is proving effective in building a robust solution while maintaining code quality and testability. Each step builds naturally on the previous ones, allowing for organic growth of the codebase.
