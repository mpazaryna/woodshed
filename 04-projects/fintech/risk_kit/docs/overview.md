# Risk Analysis: Technical Background for Multi-Domain Applications

## 1. Introduction to Risk Analysis

Risk analysis is a fundamental concept in various fields, including finance, insurance, environmental science, and engineering. It involves the systematic process of identifying, assessing, and mitigating potential threats or uncertainties that could impact the objectives of a system, project, or investment.

## 2. Core Concepts in Risk Analysis

### 2.1 Risk Components

- **Probability**: The likelihood of an event occurring.
- **Impact**: The potential consequences if the event occurs.
- **Exposure**: The extent to which an entity is susceptible to a risk.

### 2.2 Risk Measures

- **Expected Value**: E(X) = Σ(x_i * p_i), where x_i are possible values and p_i are their probabilities.
- **Variance**: Var(X) = E[(X - μ)^2], where μ is the expected value.
- **Standard Deviation**: σ = √Var(X)
- **Value at Risk (VaR)**: The maximum potential loss at a given confidence level over a specific time horizon.
- **Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)**: The expected loss given that the loss exceeds VaR.
