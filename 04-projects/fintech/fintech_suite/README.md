# Fintech Suite

## Overview

The Fintech Suite is a comprehensive collection of Python modules designed for financial analysis, trading, and risk management. This suite combines cutting-edge techniques in quantitative finance with machine learning to provide a powerful toolkit for financial professionals, researchers, and developers.

## Documentation

1. [Executive Summary](./docs/executive-summary.md): Overall project summary.
2. [Feasability](./docs/feasability.md): A Claude AI opinion on the project feasability.


## Modules

The suite consists of three main modules:

1. [trading_kit](./docs/trading_kit.md): A toolkit for technical analysis, algorithmic trading, and backtesting.
2. [risk_kit](./docs/risk_kit.md): A robust set of tools for financial risk analysis across various domains.
3. [finance_kit](./docs/finance_kit.md): A comprehensive suite for financial analysis, including valuation, capital budgeting, and financial modeling.

Each module can be used independently or in combination with the others for more comprehensive analysis.

## Features

- **Technical Analysis**: Implement and backtest trading strategies using a wide range of technical indicators and chart patterns.
- **Risk Management**: Assess and manage financial risks using both traditional methods and advanced machine learning techniques.
- **Financial Modeling**: Perform detailed financial analysis, including DCF valuation, capital budgeting, and portfolio optimization.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Leverage AI and ML techniques for pattern recognition, risk prediction, and strategy optimization.
- **Flexible Architecture**: Modules can be used independently or combined for more comprehensive analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)

Refer to each module's repository for specific installation instructions and dependencies.

### Quick Start

Here's a simple example of how you might use the modules together:

```python
from trading_kit import TechnicalAnalysis
from risk_kit import RiskMetrics
from finance_kit import Valuation

# Perform technical analysis
ta = TechnicalAnalysis(data)
signals = ta.generate_signals()

# Assess risk
risk = RiskMetrics(data)
var = risk.calculate_var()

# Perform valuation
valuation = Valuation(company_data)
intrinsic_value = valuation.dcf_model()

# Make trading decision based on combined analysis
# ...
```

## Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

Using SSH:

```
$ USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

Not using SSH:

```
$ GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
