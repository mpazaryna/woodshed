# Building tools with risk_kit

The [Risk Calculator](https://github.com/mpazaryna/risk_calculator) provides a command-line interface (CLI) that leverages the powerful functionalities of the risk_kit module. This blog post will explore how the project is structured, the modular nature of risk_kit, and how it contributes to the flexibility of the Risk Calculator.

## Project Overview

The Risk Calculator is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, and multiplication—using the risk_kit library. The project is structured to allow easy extension and modification, making it a robust tool for risk analysis.

- [Risk Kit](https://github.com/mpazaryna/risk_kit)


## Key Components

**CLI Interface:** The project uses the click library to create a user-friendly command-line interface. Users can easily perform calculations by invoking commands like add-numbers, subtract-numbers, and multiply-numbers.

**Modular Design:** The core of the Risk Calculator is its reliance on the risk_kit module, which encapsulates various mathematical operations. This modular approach allows developers to easily integrate additional functionalities or replace existing ones without significant changes to the overall architecture.

## Implementation of risk_kit

The risk_kit module is imported in the cli.py file, where its functions—add, subtract, and multiply—are utilized. Here’s a snippet of how these functions are integrated:

```python
import click
from risk_kit.adder import add, multiply, subtract

@click.group()
def cli():
    """A simple calculator CLI using risk_kit functions."""
    pass

@cli.command()
@click.argument("a", type=float)
@click.argument("b", type=float)
def add_numbers(a, b):
    """Add two numbers."""
    result = add(a, b)
    click.echo(f"The result of {a} + {b} is: {result}")
```

## Flexibility Through Modularity

The modular nature of risk_kit allows the Risk Calculator to be flexible in several ways:

Easy Integration: New mathematical operations can be added to the risk_kit module, and the Risk Calculator can utilize them without needing to modify its core logic.

Customizability: Users can customize the calculator by adding their own functions to risk_kit, making it adaptable to specific needs.
Maintainability: The separation of concerns ensures that changes in the risk_kit module do not affect the CLI directly, making the codebase easier to maintain.

## Conclusion

The Risk Calculator exemplifies how a modular approach can enhance flexibility and maintainability in software development. By leveraging the risk_kit module, the project not only provides essential arithmetic functionalities but also sets the stage for future enhancements. Whether you're a developer looking to extend the tool or a user seeking a reliable risk assessment calculator, the Risk Calculator is a valuable resource in your toolkit.
