# Code Quality

To ensure that the code adheres to the established coding standards, developers should run the command `invoke pre-commit` before committing any changes. This will automatically check the code for style issues and other potential problems, helping to maintain a high quality of code throughout the project.

The .flake8 configuration file outlines specific coding standards and rules for maintaining code quality in the codebase. Here's a summary of the expected coding standards based on the provided .flake8 instructions:

## Summary of Expected Coding Standards

1. **Line Length**: Maximum line length is set to 120 characters.

2. **Ignored Errors**:
   Several error codes are ignored to accommodate specific coding practices:
   E203, E266, E501, E302, E305, W503, W293, W291, W292, D100, D101, D102, D103, D104, D200, D205, D400, F401, F841.

3. **Complexity**:
   Maximum complexity for functions is set to 10, encouraging simpler and more maintainable code.

4. **Docstring Convention**:
   The project follows the Google style for docstrings, ensuring consistency in documentation.

5. **Per-File Ignores**:
   Specific files have tailored ignores to prevent unnecessary linting errors:
   - `__init__.py`: F401, D104
   - `tests/*`: D100, D101, D102, D103, F401
   - `docs/source/conf.py`: E402
   - `tasks.py`: D100
   - `src/risk_kit/*.py`: D100, D200, D205, D400, E501, F401

## General Coding Practices

- **Adhere to PEP 8**: Follow the Python Enhancement Proposal 8 guidelines for code style.
- **Use Type Hints**: Implement type hints for function parameters and return values to improve code clarity and type safety.
- **Comprehensive Docstrings**: Provide detailed docstrings for all functions and classes to explain their purpose and usage.
- **Unit Testing**: Implement unit tests for all core functions and edge cases to ensure code reliability and correctness.

By adhering to these standards, the codebase aims to maintain high quality, readability, and maintainability.
