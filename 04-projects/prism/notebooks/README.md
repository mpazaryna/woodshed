## Development Workflow

This project follows a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) approach, utilizing Jupyter notebooks for initial development and testing before finalizing the code in Python modules.

### Step 1: Notebook Experimentation

The `/notebooks` directory is used for:

- Initial feature development
- Exploratory data analysis
- Prototyping and testing new ideas
- Validating behavior and functionality

Notebooks allow for interactive development, making it easier to visualize results and iterate quickly on ideas.

### Step 2: Code Refinement and Modularization

Once the behavior and functionality are verified in notebooks, the code is:

- Refactored and cleaned up
- Moved into appropriate Python modules in the `/prism` directory
- Structured for better maintainability and reusability

### Step 3: Continuous Integration

After modularization:

- Formal unit tests are written
- Integration tests are developed
- The code is integrated into the main project structure

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Rapid Prototyping**: Notebooks allow for quick experimentation and validation of ideas.
2. **Visual Feedback**: Results can be easily visualized in notebooks, aiding in the development process.
