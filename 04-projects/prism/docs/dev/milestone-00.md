# PRISM Project: Milestone Completion Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the key milestones for the development of PRISM (Private Research and Intelligence System for Markets). Each milestone represents a significant phase in the project's progression, aligned with our functional programming and pipeline-driven approach. Milestones are described using Gherkin-style scenarios to clearly define the expected behavior and outcomes.

## Milestone 1: Project Setup and Core Pipeline

**Objective:** Establish the foundational structure of PRISM and implement the basic pipeline.

**Scenarios:**

```gherkin
Feature: Core Pipeline Functionality

Scenario: Run basic research pipeline
  Given a list of company names
  When I run the research pipeline
  Then I should receive a basic report for each company

Scenario: Handle errors in pipeline
  Given a pipeline with a simulated error in data collection
  When I run the research pipeline
  Then I should receive an error log with details of the failure

Feature: Module Integration

Scenario: Integrate all primary modules
  Given the core modules of company management, data collection, analysis, and reporting
  When I execute the full pipeline
  Then each module should be called in the correct order
  And the output of each module should be passed to the next module
```

**Deliverable:** A functioning, albeit basic, pipeline that can process a simple workflow from company selection to report generation.

## Milestone 2: Company Management and Data Collection

**Objective:** Develop robust company management functionality and implement comprehensive data collection mechanisms.

**Scenarios:**

```gherkin
Feature: Company Management

Scenario: Add a new company to the research list
  Given I have access to the company management system
  When I add a new company "TechCorp" with details
  Then "TechCorp" should appear in the list of companies to research

Scenario: Remove a company from the research list
  Given "FinanceCo" is in the list of companies to research
  When I remove "FinanceCo" from the list
  Then "FinanceCo" should not appear in the list of companies to research

Feature: Data Collection

Scenario: Collect public data for a company
  Given "TechCorp" is in the list of companies to research
  When I initiate data collection for "TechCorp"
  Then I should receive a dataset containing public information about "TechCorp"

Scenario: Validate collected data
  Given I have collected data for "TechCorp"
  When I run data validation
  Then I should receive a report on the completeness and accuracy of the data
```

**Deliverable:** Ability to manage lists of companies and collect relevant data from specified sources.

## Milestone 3: AI-Powered Analysis

**Objective:** Implement AI-driven analysis capabilities within the PRISM pipeline.

**Scenarios:**

```gherkin
Feature: AI Analysis

Scenario: Perform trend analysis on company data
  Given I have collected data for "TechCorp" over the past 5 years
  When I run the AI trend analysis
  Then I should receive a report highlighting key trends in "TechCorp"'s performance

Scenario: Generate industry comparisons
  Given I have data for "TechCorp" and its top 5 competitors
  When I run the AI comparative analysis
  Then I should receive a report showing "TechCorp"'s position relative to its competitors

Feature: AI Model Integration

Scenario: Integrate new AI model into pipeline
  Given I have developed a new AI model for market prediction
  When I integrate the model into the analysis pipeline
  Then the pipeline should use the new model when performing market analysis
```

**Deliverable:** Functional AI-powered analysis integrated into the PRISM pipeline.

## Milestone 4: Reporting and Visualization

**Objective:** Create comprehensive reporting capabilities with data visualization.

**Scenarios:**

```gherkin
Feature: Report Generation

Scenario: Generate comprehensive company report
  Given I have completed analysis for "TechCorp"
  When I request a full report
  Then I should receive a detailed report including financial analysis, market position, and future projections

Scenario: Create custom report
  Given I have analysis data for "TechCorp"
  When I request a custom report focusing on "market trends" and "competitive analysis"
  Then I should receive a report containing only the specified sections

Feature: Data Visualization

Scenario: Include visualizations in report
  Given I have generated a report for "TechCorp"
  When I review the report
  Then it should include relevant charts and graphs illustrating key data points
```

**Deliverable:** Ability to generate detailed, visually appealing reports as the final output of the PRISM pipeline.

## Milestone 5: Extensibility and Documentation

**Objective:** Enhance PRISM's flexibility for various investigation types and complete project documentation.

**Scenarios:**

```gherkin
Feature: Extensibility

Scenario: Customize pipeline for specific industry
  Given I have a configuration file for the "healthcare" industry
  When I run the pipeline with this configuration
  Then the analysis should include healthcare-specific metrics and regulations

Scenario: Add new data source to pipeline
  Given I have developed a module to collect data from a new financial database
  When I integrate this module into the data collection phase
  Then the pipeline should collect and incorporate data from this new source

Feature: Documentation

Scenario: Access API documentation
  Given I am a developer new to the PRISM project
  When I access the API documentation
  Then I should find clear instructions on how to use each module and function

Scenario: Follow user guide to run investigation
  Given I am a new user of PRISM
  When I follow the user guide to conduct a basic company investigation
  Then I should be able to successfully generate a report without additional assistance
```

**Deliverable:** A fully documented, extensible PRISM system capable of handling various investigation types.
