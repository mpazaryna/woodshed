# PRISM: Architecture Document

## 1. Introduction

PRISM (Private Research and Intelligence System for Markets) is a Python-based project designed to facilitate AI-assisted research on private companies. This document outlines the architectural decisions, core design principles, and implementation strategy for PRISM.

## 2. Architectural Approach

### 2.1 Functional Programming Paradigm

PRISM adopts a functional programming approach, leveraging composition and pure functions. This choice is driven by several factors:

1. **Simplicity**: Functional programming promotes clear, concise code that is easier to understand and maintain.
2. **Testability**: Pure functions are inherently easier to test, as they produce consistent outputs for given inputs.
3. **Composability**: Functional composition allows for the creation of complex operations from simple, reusable functions.
4. **Immutability**: Emphasis on immutable data structures reduces side effects and potential bugs.
5. **Parallelization**: Functional code is often easier to parallelize, which may be beneficial for future scaling.

### 2.2 Pipeline-Driven Process

The core of PRISM is a pipeline-driven process, encapsulated in `pipeline.py`. This approach offers several advantages:

1. **Clear Flow**: The pipeline provides a clear, linear representation of the research process.
2. **Modularity**: Each step in the pipeline is a separate function, allowing for easy modification or replacement.
3. **Extensibility**: New steps can be easily added to the pipeline without major refactoring.
4. **Flexibility**: The order of operations can be adjusted by rearranging pipeline steps.

### 2.3 Why Not Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

While OOP is a powerful paradigm, it's not being used as the primary approach in PRISM for the following reasons:

1. The research process is inherently sequential and data-flow oriented, which aligns well with functional programming and pipeline architecture.
2. The project doesn't require complex state management or intricate relationships between entities that would benefit significantly from OOP.
3. Functional programming provides sufficient structure and modularity for our needs without the additional complexity that OOP might introduce.
4. The team's existing expertise in functional programming allows for faster development and easier maintenance.

## 3. Project Structure

```
prism/
├── __init__.py
├── pipeline.py
├── company.py
├── collector.py
├── analysis.py
├── reporting.py
└── utils/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── logger.py
    └── error_handler.py
```

- `pipeline.py`: Orchestrates the entire research process.
- `company.py`: Handles company list management.
- `collector.py`: Manages data gathering from various sources.
- `analysis.py`: Contains AI-driven analysis functions.
- `reporting.py`: Generates and formats reports.
- `utils.py`: Houses utility functions used across the project.

## 4. Extensibility for Multiple Investigations

PRISM is designed as a modular system, allowing for easy adaptation to various types of investigations:

1. **Customizable Pipeline**: The main pipeline in `pipeline.py` can be easily modified or extended for different types of investigations.
2. **Pluggable Components**: Each module (`company_management.py`, `data_collection.py`, etc.) can be customized or replaced to suit specific investigation needs.
3. **Configuration-Driven**: Investigation-specific parameters can be managed through configuration files, allowing for easy customization without code changes.
4. **Extendable Analysis**: The `analysis.py` module can be extended with new AI models or analytical techniques for specialized investigations.

Example of using PRISM for different investigations:

```python
from prism import pipeline

# Standard financial investigation
financial_report = pipeline.run_investigation('financial')

# Specialized market penetration analysis
market_report = pipeline.run_investigation('market_penetration')

# Custom investigation with specific config
custom_report = pipeline.run_investigation('custom', config_path='path/to/config.yaml')
```

## 5. Documentation and Deliverables

All project documentation, including this architecture document, user guides, and API references, will be delivered in Markdown format. This ensures:

1. Version control compatibility
2. Easy rendering on various platforms (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
3. Simple conversion to other formats if needed (PDF, HTML)

Code will be thoroughly documented using docstrings and inline comments following PEP 257 and PEP 8 guidelines.

## 6. Conclusion

PRISM's architecture, built on functional programming principles and a pipeline-driven approach, provides a flexible, maintainable, and extensible system for AI-assisted private company research. This design allows for easy adaptation to various investigation types while maintaining code simplicity and testability.
