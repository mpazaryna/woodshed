Enhance the procedural framework with:

NARRATIVE ELEMENTS:
1. Investigation depth and complexity
2. Character dynamics and conflicts
3. Procedural detail and accuracy
4. Evidence complexity and connections
5. Resolution strength and impact

STRUCTURAL IMPROVEMENTS:
1. Case progression logic
2. Clue placement and timing
3. Red herring balance and purpose
4. Breakthrough setup and execution
5. Resolution pacing and satisfaction

CREATIVE ENHANCEMENTS:
1. Unique case elements and twists
2. Distinct team dynamics and conflicts
3. Original challenges and obstacles
4. Fresh procedures and methods
5. Novel solutions and approaches

When enhancing, ensure:
- Procedural accuracy maintained throughout
- Character relationships develop naturally
- Case complexity remains balanced
- Evidence trail stays clear and logical
- Resolution satisfies all setup elements
