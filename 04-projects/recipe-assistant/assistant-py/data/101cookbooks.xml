										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I call this summer toast. It&#8217;s the result of a couple things in my life colliding into a really good lunch option. Here’s what we’re looking at. Slices of homemade sourdough bread rubbed with olive oil are broiled until golden and toasted. Each slice is smeared with Greek yogurt that has been absolutely <em>loaded</em> with grated zucchini and carrots, toasted walnuts, smashed garlic, and herbs. Tons of good stuff. The finishing touch comes from a scan of my late-summer refrigerator which always has <a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/roasted-cherry-tomatoes/">roasted cherry tomatoes</a>, olives, and basil. It’s the perfect easy lunch.<br /><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/summer-toast-v.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="toasted sourdough topped with Greek yogurt and shredded vegetables" width=" 620" border="0" /></p>
<h2 class="p1">The Inspiration: Summer Toast</h2>
<p class="p1">There have been some amazing cookbook releases this year and I’ve been cooking regularly from a short stack of them. One of my absolute favorites has been <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/sebze-vegetarian-recipes-from-my-turkish-kitchen-ozlem-warren/20388295">Sebze: Vegetarian Recipes from My Turkish Kitchen</a></em> by <a href="https://ozlemsturkishtable.com/">Ozlem Warren</a>. I checked it out from the library, then immediately bought my own copy. There’s a yogurt-based <em>meze</em> she shares on page 102, where she loads yogurt with sautéed vegetables, herbs and nuts. It is fantastic, no notes. But as the temperature kept climbing here in LA, I started doing a version of it with raw, shredded zucchini and carrots (or whatever else I need to use up). <br /><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/summer-toast-2.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="grated carrots and zucchini mixed with greek yogurt to make a toast topping" width=" 620" border="0" /><br />I make it on the weekend, and use it smeared on, in, and under all sorts of things all week. It dovetails with my baking a couple loaves of sourdough each week (even when it’s hot omg) for the A+ combo you see here. For the sourdough geeks, the bread pictured is 20% whole wheat flour, 30% high-extraction flour, 50% bread flour with wild rice, toasted walnuts, and lots of lemon zest folded in.<br /><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/summer-toast-3.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="homemade sourdough bread, sliced and toasted on a baking sheet" width=" 620" border="0" /></p>
<h2 class="p1">Pro-tip</h2>
<p class="p1">The one piece of advice I have here is to use a box grater, or something similar. Skip the microplanes for grating the zucchini and carrots. Old school for the win here because you end up with hearty, well defined flecks of vegetables. I have a flat, wooden Japanese grater that is a dream to use, so keep your eyes peeled for one of those. <br /><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/summer-toast-4.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="toasted sourdough topped with Greek yogurt and shredded vegetables, olives and roasted tomatoes" width=" 620" border="0" /></p>
<h2 class="p1">An Alternative to Avocado Toast</h2>
<p class="p1">As much as I love avocado toast, this is a nice, substantial alternative. For the vegans out there, use a dairy-free yogurt. Or, for a brunch, you could set up a toast bar with this <em>and</em> avocado, and a few other spreads and compound butters.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Let’s talk about <span class="s1">Niçoise</span> Salad. It’s an arrangement traditionally made with ingredients local to the Provencal city of Nice.<span class="s1"> Purists often argue that a proper salad Niçoise has a long list of hard nos. No lettuces, no boiled potatoes, green beans are out, avocados (lol), no vinaigrette, and on and on. The list is extensive and if you want a deeper dive into the history, <a href="https://www.simplefrenchcooking.com/recipe-entry/salade-nicoise">read this</a>. What is allowed? Olive oil-packed anchovies and raw tomatoes, and salt. Many versions have evolved from this including the one I make most.<br /><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/nicoise-salad-1.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="Nicoise salad on a large serving platter" width="620" border="0" /></span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Nicoise Salad: The Inspiration </span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In recent years Niçoise salad has become a frequent “go-to” when we have friends or family over. This is because arranged on a platter it is a gorgeous, abundant, queen of a salad. More important, in this modern age, it can accommodate nearly everyone’s dietary preferences. This is no small feat here in Los Angeles and a <i>huge</i> win-win in my book. </span>This version works for vegans and vegetarians, people avoiding dairy, as well as anyone gluten-free. We’re vegetarian, but not every one is. If you want to shift things toward a more traditional Niçoise salad, you can retain the fish component. We all have a friend who is passionate about tinned fish &#8211; have them bring a favorite to serve on the side.<br /><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/nicoise-salad-2.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="ingredients for a Nicoise arranged on a counter including hard-boiled eggs, green beans, potatoes, olives, lettuces" width="620" border="0" /></span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s2"><b>Niçoise</b></span><span class="s3"><b> Salad Ingredients</b></span></h2>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Beans or lentils</strong>: For a vegetarian version (as pictured) replace the traditional fish component &#8211; tuna or anchovies &#8211; with beans or lentils. You see freshly shelled cranberry beans in the photos here (boiled until tender), but French lentils are another great option. Chickpeas or cannelloni beans also work well.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Potatoes</strong>: Small, waxy potatoes are ideal here.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Lettuces</strong>: Some camps embrace lettuces as a component here, others, not so much. I love to include pockets of perfect little gem lettuces. They’re great for scooping and wrapping other ingredients and lend a fresh bolt of green to the whole scene.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Tomatoes</strong>: Ripe, seasonal, fresh tomatoes are the goal here. If you include cherry tomatoes, halve them. Larger tomatoes? Slice into quarters.</li>
<li class="p1"><a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/how-to-make-hard-boiled-eggs/"><strong>Hard boiled eggs</strong></a>: Eggs bring the protein to this salad along with any beans or lentils you might include. I include my favorite way to hard boil eggs, no grey yolks, bright yellow yolks in the recipe below.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>String Beans</strong>: Tender, green beans (or yellow beans) are a key component. Getting their texture right is the challenge. Build for a flash, until they relax a shade and brighten a bit. Then shock them in cold water.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Olives</strong>: <span class="s1" style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Niçoise olives are the traditional choice, of course, but if you have other olive varietals on hand, do let that deter you from making Niçoise salad, or Niçoise-ish Salad.</span></li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Artichokes</strong>: If I know I’m going to make a <span class="s1" style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Niçoise salad, I’ll cook a bit skillet of artichoke hearts the night prior. Eat some with dinner, and save some in the refrigerator for the Niçoise the next day. Here’s <a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/how-to-cook-artichokes/">how to cook artichokes</a> along with some tips because I love them so much. </span></li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Vinaigrette</strong>: A strong vinaigrette is my preference here, and I include mine in the recipe below. Be sure to make it with good tasting vinegar.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Lemons</strong>: If you have a grill going, grilled halves of lemon are a nice addition.</li>
</ul>

<p class="p1">One of the things to love about Niçoise salad is that many of the components can be made ahead.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Vinaigrette: Make the vinaigrette up to 4 days in advance.</li>
<li class="p1">Artichokes can be cooked a day or two ahead.</li>
<li class="p1">Potatoes, green beans, and <a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/how-to-make-hard-boiled-eggs/">hard-boiled eggs</a> can be boiled a day ahead.</li>
<li class="p1">Lettuces can be washed and dried a day or two ahead of time.</li>
<li class="p1">Beans can been cooked from dried up to 2-3 days ahead.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Rice pilaf is a great foundation recipe to know. Once you learn to make it well, you can tweak the recipe a thousand ways to your liking. This is a favorite approach for me. Be sure to make it pretty (and extra delicious) with toppings. There are a bunch listed in the recipe.<br /><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/rice-pilaf-recipe-v.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="rice pilaf served in a bowl with an assortment of toppings" width=" 620" border="0" /></p>
<h2 class="p1">How To Make Rice Pilaf: The Technique</h2>
<p class="p1">The backbone of a good pilaf is, of course, rice. You want it fluffy and well defined. For this pilaf, you build flavor early. Onions are caramelized in a blend of olive oil and butter. The butter browns and becomes fragrant. To that, spices are added, and ingredients like beans or pulses, toasted nuts, and dried fruit are added. You have a lot of latitude here, and the combination of chickpeas, chopped dates, and pistachios (pictured) are a favorite. Water is added and the pot simmers until the rice absorbs and softens. A finishing squeeze of citrus juice and shower of herbs brightens things up. Toppings like salted yogurt and olives are the finishing touch.<br /><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/rice-pilaf-recipe-4.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="rice pilaf in a pot before serving" width=" 620" border="0" /></p>
<h2 class="p1">Rice Pilaf Variations</h2>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>In place of dates</strong>: Use dried apricots, golden raisins, dried cherries, or dried figs.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Spices</strong>: The cinnamon version shared here is wonderful, but you can go in entirely different. directions by swapping in za’atar, curry powder, onion and garlic powder, mushroom powder, etc.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Experiment with grains</strong>:<span class="Apple-converted-space" style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Adding a percentage of whole grains (or fast-cooking lentils) to a typical pilaf is a great way to incorporate a bit of a nutritional boost and ingredient diversity. For 2 cups of basmati rice a great place to start is 25%.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/rice-pilaf-recipe-3.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="a pot of rice pilaf served on a table with bowls and yogurt" width=" 620" border="0" /></p>
<h2 class="p1">To Reheat</h2>
<p class="p1">The key to reheating a rice pilaf like this one is to add a few tablespoons of water to the pan or dish you’re using. Heat gently, give it a good stir, and then go for a second round of heating. You mainly want to avoid the rice drying out, so adding a bit of moisture really helps.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is a variation of the roasted tomato soup recipe I featured in <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/super-natural-cooking-five-delicious-ways-to-incorporate-whole-and-natural-foods-into-your-cooking-a-cookbook-heidi-swanson/6706091">Super Natural Cooking</a></em>. I love it because it’s one of those recipes that is</span><span class="s2"> quite simple, but the results are absolutely chef’s kiss. You use just a handful of ingredients &#8211; tomatoes, garlic, red pepper, etc. &#8211; then slice and roast them to the point of browning and collapse. Puree, season with a kiss of smoked paprika, and enjoy. That&#8217;s it.<br /><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/roasted-tomato-soup-v.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="roasted tomato soup in a bowl with various toppings" width="620" border="0" /></span><br /></span></p>
<h2 class="p3">Roasted Tomato Soup: Inspiration</h2>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The inspiration for this soup came years ago when </span><span class="s4">I picked up a <a href="https://www.mariquita.com/features/mystery-box/">Mariquita Farm Mystery Box</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><em>So</em> heavy, I suspect it weighed in the thirty pound range. The bus was overflowing with a rainbow of produce &#8211; little gem lettuce, Hungarian spicy peppers, lacinato kale, Danish carrot beets, minicor carrots, tomatoes, sweet peppers, chard and scallions. Hidden beneath the rest of it, at the very bottom, so as not to crush her leafy neighbors, was a hefty rouge vif d&#8217;estampe pumpkin the color of a fiery sunset. Plenty to keep the kitchen lively in the coming week. But we started by reaching for the tomatoes &#8211; slicing them, dicing, and enjoying them raw. And there *still* were plenty that needed to be used up. I thought of the roasted tomato soup in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1587612755/heidiswanson-20/"><span class="s5">Super Natural Cooking</span></a>, fired up the oven, and started slicing.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>These iced sesame noodles have become my summertime bestie. Is it hot out? If so, there’s a good chance this is going to be on the table. I&#8217;m here to share the details before we run out of summer. Imagine a rotating cast of long, slurp-able noodles (soba, pici, somen, spaghetti, etc.) tangling with a creamy sesame sauce, topped with 4-5 easy toppings. That’s the basic formula. The noodles are served family-style in a large bowl of ice water. Everyone mixes up their own individual, custom portions. So good, so fun. Definitely a Japanese-inspired concept, dovetailing, in our house, with whatever is popping up at California farmers’ markets. I encourage you to incorporate whatever your family loves and the ingredients shining at your local markets.<br /><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/sesame-noodles-recipe-v.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="sesame noodles in a bowl with ginger, zest, and chile oil toppings" width="620" border="0" /></span></p>
<h2 class="p1">Building an Iced Sesame Noodle Bowl</h2>
<p class="p1">Aside from boiling the noodles, nearly everything else here can be prepared ahead of time. It’s part of what’s great about this and what makes it a weeknight-friendly meal. I like to toss some chopped veggies (whatever is on hand &#8211; broccoli, asparagus, etc.) in the pasta water after the noodles come out, keeping the cooking to a single pot. To summarize, here are the main components of the meal:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Noodles</strong>: Keep a selection of favorites on hand.<br /><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/sesame-noodles-recipe-5.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="noodles floating in ice water surrounded by toppings and sesame sauce on a table" width="620" border="0" /></span></li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Homemade sesame sauce</strong>: make ahead and refrigerate for up to a week. Recipe below. Also, consider experimenting with almond butter and/or peanut butter in place of the tahini or sesame paste for another variation.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Toppings</strong>: I’ll list off twenty-plus favorites. Choose 4-5 for your meal.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Side veggies</strong>: And easy boost! As mentioned above, grab something that can do a quick boil in your pasta water after you remove the noodles. More ideas below.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/sesame-noodles-recipe-4.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="five different noodles to make sesame noodles with" width="620" border="0" /></span></p>
<h2 class="p1">Let’s Talk about Noodle Options</h2>
<p class="p1">I’ve done fantastic versions of this meal with all of the following. Think long and slurp-able on the noodle front. I also check my noodle labels to make sure they&#8217;re not <em>wildly</em> salted, to be honest, I&#8217;ve been caught off guard  on a number of occasions.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Soba</strong>: I love the combination of buckwheat soba noodles and sesame and soba traditionally works well with sesame sauces similar to this one. Soba is a frequent go-to when I make this recipe and cold soba, in general, is summertime wonderful.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Somen</strong>: These thin Japanese wheat noodles are a crowd-pleasing favorite. Especially if you have picky eaters that aren’t as receptive to brown noodles.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Homemade <a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/pici-pasta/">pici</a></strong>: A hand-rolled Italian pasta, if you’re up for more of a project, cold <a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/pici-pasta/">pici</a> really makes this whole situation something extra special.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Spaghetti</strong>: Give whatever spaghetti you love a try. I love the <span class="s2" style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"><a href="https://shopfelicettipasta.com/products/monograno-felicetti-farro-spaghetti-pasta">Monograno Felicetti Farro Spaghetti</a> </span><span style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">for its texture and boosted nutrition profile (not sponsored, just a fan), and the farro plays beautiful with the creamy sesame sauce.</span><span class="Apple-converted-space" style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> Pictured here.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/sesame-noodles-recipe-1.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="sesame noodles in a bowl surrounded by a variety of toppings" width="620" border="0" /></span></p>
<h2 class="p3">Sesame Noodle Toppings</h2>
<p class="p3">Choose 4-5 different toppings. I feel like grated ginger is a non-negotiable here. So good. And I leave any spicy component out of the base sesame sauce so that each person can light up their bowls with whatever level of spicy they can handle.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p3"><strong>grated ginger</strong>: peel ginger with a spoon and grate with a microplane grater into a small bowl. Key topping!</li>
<li class="p3"><strong>something spicy</strong>: favorites for this recipe include Calabrian chile oil, chile crisp, tobanjan</li>
<li class="p3"><strong>toasted seeds and/or nuts</strong>: <a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/zaatar-recipe/">za’atar</a>, traditional gomasio, I also make a red gomasio-ish (pictured above) that I’ll post the recipe for soon, toasted peanuts, etc.</li>
<li><strong>tomatoes</strong>: specifically, these <a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/roasted-cherry-tomatoes/"><span style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">roasted cherry tomatoes</span></a><br /><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/sesame-noodles-recipe-3.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="eating sesame noodles with chopsticks from a bowl" width="620" border="0" /></span></li>
<li><strong>crunchy bits</strong>: for example,  fried shallots or crispy jalapeño pieces (WB brought these home from TJ’s a few weeks ago)</li>
<li><strong>pesto</strong>: a little dollop of <a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/pesto-recipe/">pesto</a> in your bowl along with the sesame sauce is pretty great.</li>
<li>lemon zest or chopped, preserved lemons</li>
<li>makrut lime leaves: thinly slivered</li>
<li><a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/kale-chips/">kale chips</a></li>
<li>chives</li>
<li>chopped scallions</li>
<li>grated carrots</li>
<li><a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/how-to-make-hard-boiled-eggs/">hard boiled eggs</a>, quartered</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3">And as we move into later summer and early fall, and the weather is still hot enough for cold noodles, but the seasonal ingredients are shifting, here are a few other ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p3">thinly sliced, crisp apple</li>
<li class="p3"><a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/toasted-pumpkin-seeds/">toasted pumpkin seeds</a></li>
<li class="p3"><a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/simple-cauliflower/">simple cauliflower</a></li>
<li class="p3"><a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/roasted-cauliflower/">roasted cauliflower</a>: This variation is next on my list, iced sesame noodles plus roasted cauliflower and some of the other ingredients in <a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/roasted-cauliflower/">this recipe</a> as toppings &#8211; mint, arugula, chopped dates, red onion, and a spice blend of toasted pine nuts, sesame, cumin, coriander, and red pepper flakes. It&#8217;s gonna be good.<br /><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/sesame-noodles-recipe-6.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="noodles in ice water with ice cubes and citrus slices" width="620" border="0" /></span></li>
<li class="p3">Also! For the iced noodle bowl (above), play around. Add thin citrus slices &#8211; Meyer lemon, rangpur lime, kishu mandarin, orange, key lime are all recent favorites. You can also add fresh herbs or lime leaves or use a cold broth. I have a cold mushroom broth that works really well. The recipe for that one is in <em><a href="https://www.heidiswanson.com/super-natural-simple">Super Natural Simple</a>, </em>in the back.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="p3">While You’re At It: Add a Side Veggie!</h2>
<p class="p3">Broccoli florets, asparagus tops, green beans, yellow beans, corn &#8211; these are just a few of the vegetables I’ve cooked in a flash after cooking the noodles for the bowls. Boil for a mint or so, strain under cold water and serve on the side. Everyone loves to work the vegetables into their noodle bowls as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span class="s1">When I first wrote about this frozen yogurt recipe in 2007, I started by saying, “Pinkberry Frozen Yogurt has nothing on the recipe in <a href="https://www.davidlebovitz.com/"><span class="s2">David Lebovitz&#8217;s</span></a> cookbook <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-perfect-scoop-revised-and-updated-200-recipes-for-ice-creams-sorbets-gelatos-granitas-and-sweet-accompaniments-a-cookbook-david-lebovitz/11368929"><span class="s2">The Perfect Scoop</span></a></em>.” It was peak fro-yo era and in front of me was a book brimming with both wildly creative and classic ice cream flavors. While it might seem a bit peculiar to choose to go the frozen yogurt route over ice cream, Wayne loves yogurt. He had been traveling all week, I chipped the freezer burn off the ice cream maker and churned up the creamiest frozen yogurt for him to enjoy when he arrived home. You should absolutely make some too.<br /><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/frozen-yogurt-recipe-v.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="frozen yogurt" width="620" border="0" /><br /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">David’s <em>simple, </em>three ingredient recipe delivers a wonderfully tangy, not-too-sweet, creamy white cloud of perfect frozen deliciousness. And, believe me, as a California native, I know good fro-yo when I taste it. It is actually rare thing. You might be tempted to add sweet swirls, crushed fruit, or chocolate<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>chunks. For the first go-around, don’t. Restrain yourself. Use good yogurt and enjoy it straight the first time around. Decide on twists for the future.<br /></span></p>
<h2>Which Ice Cream Maker?</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For a long time I used a little <span class="s2">Krups Ice Cream Maker</span>, one of the ones you leave in your freezer. It served me well for years, delivering batch after creamy batch. I eventually invested in a <a href="https://www.breville.com/us/en/products/ice-cream/bci600.html">Breville Smart Scoop</a>. David has <a href="https://www.davidlebovitz.com/how-to-buy-an-ice-cream-maker-machine-cuisinart-breville-ninja/">ice cream maker recommendations</a> on his site as well. Spoiler alert,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>he also has a Smart Scoop but also highlights others at a range of price points.<br /><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/frozen-yogurt-recipe-2.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="frozen yogurt" width="620" border="0" /></span></p>
<h2 class="p1">Frozen Yogurt Variations:</h2>
<ul>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>Plain Whole-Milk Yogurt</strong>: David noted in the comments below, “I’m glad many of you’ve been enjoying the frozen yogurt and thanks to Heidi for sharing the recipe. To those of you who’ve asked about reducing the fat in the recipe, I often make this with plain whole-milk yogurt which I don’t strain. Simply substitute equal quantities: 1 cup whole-milk yogurt per 1 cup strained yogurt. In the book, I give instructions for making frozen yogurts both ways with plenty of fresh-fruit variations, including strawberry, peach, cherry, and berry. </span>The version Heidi made has a nice tangy yogurt flavor and is creamier than one made with unstrained yogurt. Low-fat yogurt can be used but the frozen yogurt will have a relatively firm texture once it’s deep-chilled in your freezer. Happy churning!”</li>
<li class="p3"><strong>Almond Saffron</strong>: Infuse a pinch of saffron into a couple teaspoons of almond extract for an almond-saffron twist.</li>
<li class="p3"><strong>With Granola</strong>: This frozen yogurt is really great topped with this crunch Peanut Butter Granola</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about how to make a great vegetarian poke bowl. Poke is a much-loved, traditional, raw fish preparation, long popular in Hawaii. Fishermen would season bits of their catch, and snack on it while working. Poke (pronounced poh-kay) has exploded in popularity, well beyond Hawaii, in recent years. The version I&#8217;m posting today is for any of you who love the idea of poke or poke bowls, but don&#8217;t eat fish for whatever reason. Vegetarian poke bowls are particularly fantastic this time of year because they&#8217;re light, clean, filling but not heavy, you know?</p>

<h2>Vegetarian Poke Bowl: The Components</h2>
<p>I typically use a <a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/watermelon-poke-recipe/">watermelon poke</a>, a version of <a href="https://toirokitchen.com/blogs/recipes/mochi-mugi-barley-rice">this sushi rice</a> (but any favorite sushi rice / blend will do), and a host of other vibrant toppings. Here you see firm, organic tofu, sliced avocado, blanched asparagus, shaved watermelon radish, and micro sprouts. If you have <a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/guacamole/">guacamole</a> on hand, use a dollop of that! The bowl is drizzled, simply, with good soy sauce. And there&#8217;s a sprinkling of sesame seeds and scallions. The other topping I <em>really</em> crave, not pictured here, is a showering of crispy, fried shallots. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/vegetarian-poke-bowl-2.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="How to Make a Great Vegetarian Poke Bowl" border="0" /></p>
<h2>Seasonal Variations</h2>
<p>When it comes to toppings, what you see here is just a jumping off point. And I encourage you to play around with all the components. For example, you might trade in roasted squash cubes for the watermelon later in the year. Or, perhaps, a different melon varietal. And you could do roasted onions in place of scallions. Or, play around with the drizzle on top. For a quick poke bowl, I just do a soy sauce drizzle, but you could whip up something more complex. Have fun with it!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/vegetarian-poke-bowl-3.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="How to Make a Great Vegetarian Poke Bowl" border="0" /><br />Although, it can be argued, a vegetarian poke bowl isn&#8217;t a <em>real</em> poke bowl, it&#8217;s a great meal just the same. Keep your eyes peeled for other inspiration as well. I love seeing the creative vegetarian versions on menus at poke spots all over. Lots of ideas there that you might replicate in your own kitchens!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Hard boiled eggs are a frequent ingredient in many meals and recipes. They&#8217;re foundational for countless cooks, and much-loved for being portable, filling, protein-rich, and adaptable. Once peeled they can be sliced, grated, smashed, or pureed. The key is landing on a cooking method that delivers perfect eggs every single time. So, let&#8217;s talk it through.</p>
<h2>What Makes A Perfect Hard Boiled Egg?</h2>
<p>The goal here is to cook fully set, smooth, eggs. That when cut open reveal a creamy, well-set, bright yellow yolk with no grey ring or discoloration. A lot of divots from peeling aren&#8217;t ideal, but there are methods to achieving divot-free eggs, no worries!<br /><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/hard-boiled-eggs-v.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="hard boiled eggs cut in half" width="620" border="0" /></span></p>

        <meta itemprop="contentUrl" content="https://content.jwplatform.com/videos/YLetHm2a.mp4" />
      </div>
<h2>The Method</h2>
<p>There are a few key steps here. Let&#8217;s go through them with photos.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, gently place your eggs in a saucepan. <br /><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/hard-boiled-eggs-2.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="eggs placed into an empty saucepan" width="620" border="0" /></span></li>
<li><span class="s1">Next, cover the eggs with water by about an inch.<br /><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/hard-boiled-eggs-3.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="eggs in a saucepan covered with water" width="620" border="0" /></span></li>
<li><span class="s1">After that, bring everything to a boil over medium-high heat (uncovered). Once the water reaches a boil, when the eggs start to tap a bit against the bottom of the saucepan, turn off the heat, cover, and set a timer for exactly 10 minutes. <br /><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/hard-boiled-eggs-4.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="a saucepan with lid on" width="620" border="0" /></span></li>
<li><span class="s1">In the meantime, prepare a medium bowl with water and some ice cubes. Once your timer goes off, use a strainer, spider, or slotted spoon to move the eggs into the ice water. This is one of the steps a lot of people get wrong (or skip). You really want to cool they eggs down <em>entirely</em>. Peeling warm eggs is much more difficult than peeling cold one, and patience is king here. The quick cool-down also helps keep the eggs bright, yellow, and ring-free.<br /><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/hard-boiled-eggs-5.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="hard boiled eggs cooling in a bowl of ice and water" width="620" border="0" /></span></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="p1">How To Best Peel a Hard Boiled Egg</h2>
<p class="p1">This is something people really struggle with. Peeling an egg is actually trickier than you think, especially if you don&#8217;t want to lose a good amount of the egg along with the peel. We&#8217;ve all been there. Keep in mind that fresh eggs are always trickier to peel than eggs that are a bit older, but this is a method that helps remove the egg shell in strips and avoiding divots in the eggs. Here’s the technique:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1"><strong>Crack the shell all over</strong>. One end of the egg (bottom) will vibe more hollow than the other, tap this end on your countertop. Then gently tap, tap, tap all around the egg to crack and loosen the entire shell. Some people will tell you to gently roll the egg on your countertop, and I&#8217;m not a fan of that technique. I&#8217;ve had eggs split around the circumference while carefully rolling, so tap, tap, tap it is.<br /><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/hard-boiled-eggs-6.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="a hand holding a hard boiled egg before peeling with cracked shell" width="620" border="0" /></span></li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Start peeling</strong>. The hollow end (bottom) is where you want to start. Depending on the egg, you might be able to softly work your thumb under the membrane, pushing the shell away from the egg. If you&#8217;re lucky it will peel in long strips. If not, keep trying to get under that membrane and peel from there.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Rinse</strong>. Give each egg a quick rinse and pat dry. This gets rid of any crunchy peel residual that might still be clinging to the egg. <br /><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/hard-boiled-eggs-7.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="one peeled pard boiled egg" width="620" border="0" /></span></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="p1">How Long Can You Store Hard Boiled Eggs</h2>
<p class="p1">Some say hard boiled eggs will last up to a week, but I try to use them within 4 days or so.</p>
<h2>Why I prefer This Method For Hard Boiling Eggs</h2>
<p>There are a number of other approaches to hard boiling eggs out there, but I always come back to this one. Common sense would have you boil the water first, drop the eggs in and continue to boil for a set amount of time. This minimizes the variables, because you&#8217;re dealing with constants &#8211; the temperature of boiling water and a set time period. But this method has you add a towel to your pan to keep the eggs from breaking as they boil, and tbh, I don&#8217;t love the cleanup from that. <br /><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/hard-boiled-eggs-8.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="hard boiled eggs smashed in a bowl" width="620" border="0" /></span><br />The method I use here is gentle with the eggs from the start, and it&#8217;s reliably good. The only wild card I&#8217;ve run into is using an <a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/induction-stove/">induction stove</a> burner. It boils the water SO FAST, the eggs end up needing a slightly longer time under cover. If you&#8217;re using induction, bring them to a boil a bit more slowly, a 6 setting works well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I first posted this pancake recipe in 2006, and figured it was time to elaborate a bit. This is a recipe I use <em>a lot</em>, resulting in a beautiful, classic stack of pancakes with impossibly tender crumb and golden edges. The pancakes have lightness and lift, and good color. That said, the real reason I love this recipe is because it’s endlessly adaptable. I’ve used it as a base pancake recipe and jumping off point<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>for endless pancake adaptations and I heartily encourage you to do the same. You can experiment with a range of flours, liquids, and add-ins, and I list off a number of suggestions below. If you&#8217;re looking for classic pancakes to make when camping, your search is over.<br /><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/FLUFFY-PANCAKE-RECIPE-2.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="Fluffy Pancakes Recipe" border="0" /></span></p>
<h2 class="p1">Let’s Make a Great Pancake Batter</h2>
<p class="p1">The best pancakes start with great batter. You don’t want your batter too thick, because pancakes made with really thick batter tend to cook well on the outside, but the inside they can be undercooked. Worse, in my opinion, is too thin pancake batter. Don’t get me wrong, I love a good crepe, but if you’re after the perfect fluffy weekend pancake? You don’t want your batter spreading out all over the pan. This recipe hits that perfect middle mark. And you can use a range of liquids, depending on what is in your refrigerator.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1">Buttermilk, Yogurt, or Milk? &#8211; use what you’ve got!</span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You can make these pancakes with just about any liquid you have on hand. I’ve listed them in order of preference. Buttermilk is wonderful, but yogurt works like a dream too. Not everyone keeps buttermilk on hand, but many people have a cup of yogurt. Go for it! Thin Greek yogurt with an equal amount of water, so for this recipe I’d combine 1 cup + 2 tablespoons Greek Yogurt with the same amount of water. If you’re using a standard yogurt don’t bother thinning it. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Both of the above (buttermilk or yogurt) are A-plus choices. Don’t have other of those? Dairy milk, oat milk, and almond milk will all give you good results. When using one of these, allow the batter to sit for 5-10 minutes before cooking, allowing the batter to thicken a bit.</span></p>
<h2 class="p6"><span class="s1">Experiment with Different Flours in Your Pancakes</span></h2>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I’ll start by saying, you can use all-purpose flour in these pancakes. But, by all means, experiment with more nutritious whole-grain flours if you have them (I have suggestions below and in the recipe). White whole wheat flour works wonderfully here. It’s the Trojan horse of whole-grain flours, because for finicky people who won&#8217;t eat anything brown or wholesome you can pass it off as white. It is made from a strain of hard white winter wheat berries and the nutritious bran and germ aren&#8217;t processed out the way they are in all-purpose white flour. The white whole wheat flour makes for a tender crumb.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rye Pancakes</span>: Replace about 1/2 of the all-purpose flour with rye flour. </span></p>
<p class="p9"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Oatmeal Pancakes</span>: Replace 1/3 cup of the flour with quick-cooking oats or uncooked oats you’ve blitzed in a blender. These pancakes are particularly good with slices of banana cooked in. Sprinkled with a bit of brown sugar in place of syrup.</p>
<p class="p9"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tiny Grain Pancakes</span>: Stir 1/2 cup cooked quinoa or millet into your batter.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s3"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Blueberry Beet Pancakes (Vegan)</span>: </span><span class="s2"> If you’re looking for a colorful <a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/archives/blueberry-beet-pancakes-vegan-recipe.html">vegan pancake</a> variation &#8211; hearty, substantial, delicious, and kid-friendly.</span><span class="s3"> </span></p>
<h2 class="p9">Variations From other Cooks</h2>
<p class="p9">A number of you have left helpful comments for tweaks and variations to this recipe over the years and I wanted to list off a couple:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lactose Intolerant</span>: Jenny noted, &#8220;I just made these this morning for my lactose-intolerant twins, substituting the 2 1/4 C buttermilk for 1C soy milk. They were absolutely awesome! I ground 2 C wheat berries, which made 4C flour, and doubled the recipe for my large family.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lots of Bran</span>: Rachael says, &#8220;I would really encourage you to try adding bran to your waffles or pancakes next time. I substitute up to half of my flour with bran (sometimes have to reduce the liquid a bit or add in something thicker, like yogurt, because the bran doesn’t absorb milk)… it lends a wonderfully nutty flavor to things and it lightens the texture substantially, not to mentioned the good-for-you fiber.</p>
<h2 class="p9">Extra Credit Fluffy</h2>
<p class="p9">I’ve tweaked the recipe here to have you separate your eggs, and beat the whites into fluffy peaks. It’s an annoying step, and requires extra effort, but is arguably worth it. You fold the whites into your batter as a last step before cooking, and it adds a really nice lightness to the pancake batter. That said, if you’re not feeling up to it, no big deal &#8211; lightly beat the two eggs and add them to the liquid mixture.<br /><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/bestpancakerecipe_07.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="Fluffy Pancakes Recipe" border="0" /></p>
<h2 class="p9">Favorite Toppings for your Pancakes</h2>
<ul>
<li class="p10"><span class="s3"><strong>Whole Blueberry Maple Syrup</strong>: This is my favorite syrup for these pancakes and worth the bit of extra effort to make. </span><span class="s2">It’s delicious, fragrant and beautiful without being overly sweet. To make blueberry maple syrup put half of a 6-ounce basket of blueberries, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup maple syrup, and 2 tablespoons of water in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Heat and stir until the sugar dissolves. Simmer for 5 or 6 minutes or until the blueberries begin to split. Remove from heat and press the blueberry mixture through a fine strainer into a bowl. Mash the fruit to get all the juiciness extracted. Throw out the solids. Stir the remaining blueberries into the warm syrup and set aside. You can use whatever sugar you like here &#8211; white, brown, coconut sugar, etc.</span></li>
<li class="p10"><strong style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"><a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/blackberry-syrup/">Homemade Blackberry Syrup</a></strong><span style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">: For blackberry fans who enjoy a bit of feistiness, this is your syrup. It&#8217;s slow-burning, sweet and spicy. Inspired by a recipe in the September 2007 issue of </span><em style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Gourmet Magazine</em><span style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">, it’s great not only over pancakes and waffles, it&#8217;s also aces in oatmeal, and in all sorts of drinks and spritzers.</span></li>
<li class="p10"><strong style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Churro-style Cinnamon Sugar</strong><span style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">: Combine 2 tablespoons cinnamon with 1/2 cup sugar and stir well. Sprinkle generously across hot buttered pancakes. You can experiment with the sugar blend beyond this as well, adding a pinch of ground cloves or curry powder, and/or crushed rose petals.</span></li>
<li class="p10"><a style="font-size: revert; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;" href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/roasted-strawberries/"><strong>Roasted Strawberries</strong></a><span style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">: These jammy gems are a favorite topping. You can make them ahead of time and refrigerate for up to a week.</span></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/compound-butter/">Compound Butters</a></strong>: One of my favorite pancake toppings for a weekend brunch. Make a compound butter or two and let people choose.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="p12"><span class="s1">Tasty Pancake Add-Ins</span></h2>
<ul>
<li class="p9"><strong>Berries</strong>: If you’re adding berries to your pancakes, add them to your pancakes after they’re on the griddle. This way your pancake batter retains its color.</li>
<li class="p9"><strong>Bananas</strong>: If you’re adding slices of banana to your pancakes, add them after the pancakes are on the griddle.</li>
<li class="p9"><strong>Boosts</strong>: Adding a boost of oat bran, wheat germ, chia seeds, nutritional yeast, kale or beet powder, hemp or flax seeds is always an option. I usually start with a tablespoon or two.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="p12"><span class="s1">Some Cooking Tips</span></h2>
<p class="p12"><span class="s1">My pan of choice for pancakes is cast iron, but any pan that holds steady heat is fine. The key is getting and maintaining the right temperature. Too much heat and you end up with burned pancakes that are under-cooked in the middle. Too little heat, and they take forever to cook, and they end up with a bit dry with a toughened crumb. I tend to start<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>at a lower temperature than I think I’ll want, and creep it up from there. </span></p>
<h2 class="p1">What Kind of Pan is Best for Pancakes?</h2>
<p class="p1">Related to the above sentiment, I nearly always use my favorite well-seasoned cast iron pan to make pancakes. That said, I keep a non-stick skillet on hand for omelettes and the like. Both pans cook these pancakes well, but the non-stick pan makes beautiful, golden, perfect-looking pancakes. The cast iron pan pancakes taste very similar, they just aren’t as uniform or golden in color. And maintaining a steady temperature seems easier using cast iron.</p>
<h2 class="p1">How do I Know When to Flip My Pancakes?</h2>
<p class="p1">For starters, when cooking pancakes, your pan shouldn’t be too hot, or too cool. If the pan is too hot, the pancakes end up overcooked before the insides have time to cook. Alternately, when the pan is too cool, pancakes take too long to cook and it impacts the texture negatively. So, control the temperature of the pan, flip when perfectly golden, and finish the second side. The batter should be set throughout and you’re ready to ladle in your next round of pancakes.  Flip pancakes with a thin spatula when the bottoms are golden. You should also see bubbles coming up.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h2 class="p12"><span class="s1">Keep Those Pancakes Warm!</span></h2>
<p class="p12"><span class="s1">Unless you have a griddle, or multiple pans going, you’re going to need make your pancakes in batches. And you don’t want your first round to go cold while you’re making the next. If you have a cooling rack you use for cookies, you can deploy it here. Place pancakes, preferably in a single layer, on the cooling rack after transferring from the skillet, and place them in a 200F oven to keep warm. I like the cooling rack better than a plate because it allows air to circulate around the entire pancake. This way, the bottom sides of the hot pancakes won’t get soggy.</span></p>
<h2 class="p1">How to Make Pancake Mix Ahead</h2>
<p class="p1">I often make a pancake mix in a jar and and add the liquid ingredients just before I’m ready to make them. Simply combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar, and salt in a Mason jar. The morning you want to make pancakes combine the buttermilk, egg yolks, and melted butter (or alternately, olive oil), fold in whipped egg whites, and you’re ready to go.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Can I Freeze these Pancakes?</h2>
<p class="p1">You can! Allow pancakes to cool completely. Arrange them on a parchment-lined baking sheet in a single layer, and freeze. Transfer to a freezer bag or container. Reheat pancakes by placing them on a baking sheet, cover tightly with foil and place in a 350F until hot, 10 minutes or so. If you don’t want to heat the oven, you can thaw them in the skillet you originally cooked them in. Another choice is to pop them in the toaster for a quick breakfast, you get a bit more crispness, but still good! Freeze for up to two months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Coming up with inspired lunch ideas takes some effort. One of the things I’ve been trying to be better about is lunches on-the-go. Often times, let&#8217;s be honest, it&#8217;s re-marketing leftovers. Too often, if we’re not going to be home for the day, we just wing it. And I’m nearly always sorry we didn’t make the effort to pack a good lunch. This is especially true if we’re on some sort of trip, towing the <a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/downloads/recipes-for-the-road">Airstream</a>. Because on those days parking dictates where you&#8217;re lunching. And just thinking about it is making me cringe. So yeah, we&#8217;re trying to do better over here and I thought I&#8217;d share some recent wins.<br /><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/LUNCH-IDEAS-chart-1.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="An Assortment of lunch ideas arranged on a table including hard-boiled egg, pickled cauliflower, edamame and a wedge of orange" width=" 620" border="0" /></p>
<h2>Lunch Ideas #1 </h2>
<p>These lunch boxes (above) came together pretty quickly. Nearly everything was a leftover, or component of a previous meal. To pull it together I peeled and chile-dusted the <a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/how-to-make-hard-boiled-eggs/">hard boiled eggs</a>, sliced the avocado and sliced the mandarin.</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/spicy-sesame-coleslaw/">Spicy Sesame Coleslaw</a>: You&#8217;ve seen it before, you&#8217;ll see it again. Lol. It&#8217;s my favorite <a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/spicy-sesame-coleslaw/">coleslaw</a>, and I&#8217;ll basically tuck in anywhere. Feathery green and red cabbages along with carrots, apples, and scallions tossed with a spicy, creamy sesame dressing.</p>
<p>2. <a style="font-size: revert; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;" href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/pickled-cauliflower/">Pickled Cauliflower</a><span style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">: The pop of color you need in your lunch. This quick pickled cauliflower delivers a good amount of tang and crunch in the midst of less structured components. I make mine with chiles, mustard seeds and slivered onion, but you can play around.</span></p>
<p>3. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chile-dusted Hard-boiled Egg:</span> Here&#8217;s how to make these. Combine equal parts chile powder and MDH chana masala powder in a small bowl. I like to use this <a style="font-size: revert; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;" href="https://www.diasporaco.com/products/kashmiri-chillies?variant=41388677726379">Kashmiri chillie powder</a><span style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">, but use what you have (and like). <a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/how-to-make-hard-boiled-eggs/">Hard boil eggs</a>, peel them, rinse, dab each egg a bit on a clean towel to take off excess water, then roll them around in the spice mixture until completely covered. Slice and serve, or pack into lunch.</span></p>
<p>4. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Turmeric-Scallion Tofu Spread</span>: This is actually leftover wonton filling from my last round of <a style="font-size: revert; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;" href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/wonton-soup/">wonton soup</a><span style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">. But it&#8217;s also great as a lettuce wrap filling, cracker and sandwich spread, and on its own. Here, I nestle it into a stack of 2-3 little gem leaves. </span><a style="font-size: revert; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;" href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/wonton-soup/">Get the recipe</a><span style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> &#8211; it&#8217;s the first part of the recipe on this page, minus the wrappers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">5. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Red-spiced Edamame</span>: I&#8217;ll write this up as its own recipe soon, it&#8217;s a homemade spice blend made by crushing Kashmiri chillies, smoked paprika, brown sugar, sesame, dried onion flakes, salt, and a kiss of cardamom together. Sprinkle generously. There are a lot of other spice blend ideas in the <a style="font-size: revert; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;" href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/membership-account/membership-checkout.html?level=1#pmpro_level_cost"><em>Spice / Herb / Flower / Zest</em></a><span style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> PDF that members get. Just about any of those are great here. Experiment! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">6. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pepita &amp; Curry Leaf Tadka</span>: I&#8217;ve definitely over-stripped my young curry tree making this lately. Toast a cup of pepitas and set aside. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat, stir in 50-ish fresh curry leaves. Continue to stir and when the leaves begin to crisp up add 2 teaspoons black mustard seeds. Keep stirring and when the seeds have toasted a bit and stopped popping, add 1/2 teaspoon chile powder. Pour this over your pepitas, toss well, and salt to taste. good on everything, Including the soba in the next lunch.<br /><br />Also: purple rice, sliced avocado, mandarin wedge, nutritional yeast kale chips</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/LUNCH-IDEAS-chart-2.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="An assortment of lunch ideas arranged on a table including soba noodles, tamagoyaki, coleslaw, and spiced seeds" width=" 620" border="0" /></p>
<h2>Lunch Ideas #2 </h2>
<p>The one component of the lunch boxes (above) that wasn&#8217;t made ahead of time, was the soba noodles. I boiled them, and ran them under cold water just before packing up. </p>
<p>6+. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Soba with Pepita &amp; Curry Leaf Tadka</span>:  The same pepitas as above (lunch ideas #1), this time tangled with cold soba.</p>
<p>7. <a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/vegan-tamagoyaki/">Vegan Tamagoyaki</a>: This is a vegan version of tamagoyaki, the much-loved Japanese rolled omelette. I like to make chickpea-tofu version, and this one is lined with nori and seasoned with scallions and herbs. They&#8217;re fantastic lunchbox heroes because you can make and roll them ahead of time. They&#8217;ll keep for a few day so you can slice and go.</p>
<p>8. <a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/how-to-cook-artichokes/">Blistered Artichoke Hearts</a>: Leftovers from dinner the previous night. I cooked these from frozen. So easy, so good. I wrote a long post about <a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/how-to-cook-artichokes/">how to cook artichokes</a> &#8211; both fresh and frozen. So, if you love artichokes, but think they&#8217;re too much work, read this. Same goes if you think the frozen ones are going to be bad. They aren&#8217;t and they&#8217;re great in scenarios like this one, quick pastas, casseroles, etc.</p>
<p>9. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fava Beans Tossed with Citrus Olive Oil</span>: These are fava beans that have been shelled, boiled for a flash, shelled again, and then splashed with a bit of lemon olive oil, and tossed with a pinch of salt. From previous dinner. I do the same with edamame, but favas are in season and I they&#8217;re worth all the shelling and peeling drama.</p>
<p>10. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kale Chips</span>: Some extra crushed kale chips tossed with the remaining pepitas. My method for epic kale chips is this: buy curly kale, make sure it&#8217;s dry if you recently washed it. Toss the kale with olive oil and scrunch it all up with your hands, be sure it&#8217;s all coated. Toss with a lot of nutritional yeast, get a good coating going. Season with salt and bake at until the chips at the edges start browning. Toss well. Continue to bake until crispy but still mostly green. Or have a look at this <a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/kale-chips/">kale chip recipe</a>.</p>
<p>Also: blood orange wedges for dessert.<br /><br /><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/LUNCH-IDEAS-23-3.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="Two bento boxes filled with lunch" width=" 620" border="0" /></p>
<h2>A Couple Pro-tips</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s actually just one main tip, but I&#8217;ll add more as I think of them. Line your bentos with parchment paper for easy clean-up (pictured below).  This isn&#8217;t as important with stainless steel containers, they clean up quite quickly. Bentos, often made of cedar, are a bit more fragile and take more care if you want them to last for many years. Also, clean up as soon as you get home. The reset is key to looking forward to your next special box lunch.<br /><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/LUNCH-IDEAS-23-4.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="Close-up of soba noodles and coleslaw" width=" 620" border="0" /></p>
<h2>More Lunch Ideas: Salads!</h2>
<p>Salads are another favorite lunch idea. For the best experience, keep the dressing on the side and toss just before eating. Also, pro-tip, leave a good amount of room or headspace in your salad vehicle, so tossing is contained and less messy. For to-go or desk salads, I love bringing the components for a <a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/nicoise-salad/">Nicoise salad</a> or Nicoise-ish salad. The lettuces and other ingredients can stand up to transportation and you get a great mix of protein, greens, and veggies all in one lunch. See photo below.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/nicoise-salad/"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/nicoise-salad-h.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="nicoise salad on a large platter" width=" 620" border="0" /></a></p>
<h2>Favorite Lunchbox Containers</h2>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bentos</span>: I have (and love) my small collection of bento boxes. They&#8217;re beautifully crafted and fit the perfect amount of food. They often come with small dividers to create separation between food, but you can also use lettuce, or other small containers to divide things up. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tiffins (or dhabbas)</span>: These containers have long been used in India to enable healthful, homemade meals outside the home. I have a circular, triple-stack stainless steel version I love for a number of reasons including durability, compactness, and security. The tiers nestle tightly making spills and accidents unlikely. I have my eye on a rectangular version as well.</p>
<p>Both bentos and tiffins have a tradition of enabling meals made with care and love. And continuing this tradition is something I try to channel when I&#8217;m packing a lunch for myself or someone I care about.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/LUNCH-IDEAS-23-5.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="Lunch arranged and ready to eat" width=" 620" border="0" /><br />I don&#8217;t mind mixing different types of lunch containers. And sometimes I&#8217;ll make an individual lunch for each person, each in its own container. But, other times I think it&#8217;s fine to load up a few family-style containers and do it that way. I think that works great for components that can be more communal, like edamame, or a bunch of dumplings, a stack of paratha, <a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/vegan-sushi/">vegan sushi</a> or quesadillas, <a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/quinoa-patties/">quinoa patties</a>, etc.</p>
<h2>Hot Lunch!</h2>
<p>Use a thermos to bring hot miso soup or tea or rasam or whatever else you can think of. This is always the icing on the cake and unfailingly makes me happy (or happier!) When I really have things lined up, I&#8217;ll bring green tea, miso soup, or soba tea and a durable glass or two wrapped in cloth. Simply rewrap when you&#8217;re finished.<br /><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/LUNCH-IDEAS-23-6.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="A sampling of lunch ideas arranged on a marble table" width=" 620" border="0" /><br />I hope this provides a bit of inspiration! It&#8217;s really wonderful to take a bit of time to sit down to a thoughtfully prepared, healthful homemade lunch and I&#8217;m never sorry about making the extra effort (in the long run). Even if it can make a morning a bit more demanding than usual, I know when I do it, I&#8217;ll eat better, feel better, and get excited about sitting down to lunch. Enjoy! -h</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span class="s1">This is a straight-forward zucchini soup with a couple twists and tricks to make it ever-so-slightly special and unique. You might not think that a soup with zucchini as the primary ingredient would be worth cooking, but this soup attempts to win you over!<br /><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/zucchini-soup-v.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="zucchini soup in a bowl with a spoon and toppings" width="620" border="0" /><br /></span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Zucchini Soup: The Inspiration</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The inspiration for this soup is simple: peak summer paired with too much zucchini. One option is to use it in a soup. But pale, watery zucchini flesh is a bit sad, and not much to look at. No worries, we have a plan. The potatoes in this recipe provide a good amount of body. And to boost the color and visual appeal, fresh spinach is the secret weapon. By giving spinach a supporting role a vibrant cilantro-flecked zucchini soup in an eye-popping shade of green is created. With a nicely boosted nutritional profile as a bonus.<br /><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/zucchini-soup-2.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="zucchini soup in a bowl with a spoon and toppings" width="620" border="0" /><br /></span></p>
<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1">Creamy without Cream</span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The goal here is a smooth, pureed soup. I wanted a creamy consistency without relying on copious amounts of heavy cream. I ended up using potato in the soup base which gives the soup a bit of heft and thickness, something people often mistake for a fully cream-based soup. You could finish this soup lwith a tiny splash of cream, or a dollop of creme fraiche, but quite honestly it’s not necessary. Delicious either way!</span></p>
<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1">Week-night Friendly</span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This soup is great if you like to meal-prep. The bulk of the time commitment here is in the chopping. Beyond that the soup only takes about 15 minutes to make once the ingredients start hitting the pot. It’s a great make-ahead option and keeps well in a jar, refrigerated, for 4-5 days.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span class="s1">A good berry pie is one of those baking skills to conquer first. I love this berry pie for its simplicity, but there are some details to fixate on to make it extra special.<br /><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/berry-pie-recipe-v.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="berry pie with a lattice top in a pie plate" width="620" border="0" /><br /></span></p>
<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1">Why I love This Pie:</span></h2>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">A great berry pie is <em>classic</em>, and there are two components to get right: the crust, and the filling. The filling for this pie is sweet enough to accent the flavors in good fruit, but not so sweet the fruit is overpowered. I’m encouraging you to make your own homemade <a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/flaky-pie-crust/">pie crust</a> here. It’s a complete game changer, and absolutely doable! A structured, golden, all-butter crust is the ideal contrast to a jammy, unstructured fruit pie filling like this one. I sprinkle the top pie crust with big grains of sugar just before baking to add a layer of crunch and sweetness. A detail that really takes the whole thing over the top.<br /><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/berry-pie-recipe-2.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="berry pie filling in a mixing bowl with spoon" width="620" border="0" /><br /></span></p>
<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1">What Kind of Berries are Best for Berry Pie?</span></h2>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">You have latitude when it comes to choosing berries for berry pie. </span><span class="s1">Use whatever great tasting berries you have on hand. It’s okay if they’re not “perfect” as long as the flavor is good. My rare (but absolute favorite) berry pie version is made entirely with wild huckleberries. Raspberries plus huckleberries is a winning combo. And the pie pictured here is a blend of (roughly) equal parts blueberries and blackberries. The formula is to use 2 pounds<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>of berries total. Pick through the berries to remove any stems or molded berries.</span></p>
<h2 class="p6"><span class="s1">Can I Use Frozen Berries?</span></h2>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Yes, you can use fruit that has been frozen in pies. Thaw to room temperature before proceeding with the recipe.</span></p>
<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1">Berry Pie: Pro-tips</span></h2>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Here are a few pro-tips for this pie.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li10"><strong><span class="s3">Glass pie dish</span></strong><span class="s4">: Number one tip, but don’t let this hold you back from baking a pie today. If you love pie, eventually you’re going to want to score a glass pie dish. It allows you to see the base of your pie take on color as it is baking. It’s a helpful confidence builder as you’re dialing in your pie baking skills.</span></li>
<li class="li10"><strong>Work with confidence</strong><span class="s1" style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">: People are often intimidate by pie baking. I’m here to tell you that even when it is bad it is good. Just keep moving forward when you’re making a pie. Don’t give up. If you’re fighting the crust, take a minute, put it back in the refrigerator to cool, regroup, then try again.<br /><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/berry-pie-recipe-4.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="crimping the edges of a berry pie crust with thumb and fingers" width="620" border="0" /></span><br /></span></li>
<li class="li10"><strong>Fully Bake Your Pie</strong>: An underbaked pie will cause a number of problems including a doughy, unstructured crust, and undeveloped filling. If using a glass baking dish, look for the pie bottom to get golden brown and toasted color. The top should be similar. You can see that I love a deeply golden and rustic crust, and can sometimes push it a bit too far, but you get the idea! Go super toasty and golden, pale flour is no good here.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/berry-pie-recipe-5.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="berry pie with a lattice top in a pie plate" width="620" border="0" /></span></p>
<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1">Berry Pie: Variations</span></h2>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">My goal here is to deliver the kind of berry pie recipe that becomes a staple in your baking repertoire &#8211; delicious, reliable, and thick with bubbling berry juices. You’ll find the base recipe down below, but here are a few little tweaks I’ve noted in my notebooks over the years.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li12"><span class="s1"><strong>Rye Crust</strong>: Use this all-butter flaky <a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/flaky-pie-crust/">pie crust</a>, but swap in 25% dark rye flour. You’ll end up with a gorgeous, rustic crust that works brilliantly in combination with berries.</span></li>
<li class="li12"><span style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"><strong>Lemon Zest Crust</strong>: Grate the zest of a lemon or two into your flour and butter as you’re making your pie crust. I don’t always have time for these little touches when making a pie, but love a little wink of lemon to level up just about any pie crust.</span></li>
<li class="li12"><strong>Rose Geranium Sugar</strong>: A bit of a wildcard suggestion here, but I happen to have a vigorous rose geranium plant on my patio, and it pairs incredibly well with berries. The night before making your pie filling use your hands to work a few fragrant rose geranium leaves into the sugar. Kind of smash and smear it, seal it in a jar overnight, and remove the leaves before making the filling with the scented sugar the next day.</li>
<li class="li12"><strong>Herb &amp; Spice Rye Berry Pie</strong>: A version of pie I had on the site for a long time (before this update!) used the rye crust suggested above, and 2 sprigs of thyme leaves plus 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon in the filling.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/berry-pie-recipe-3.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="pie crust being rolled out with wood rolling pin" width="620" border="0" /></span></p>
<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1">To Make a Lattice Pie Crust</span></h2>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">You don&#8217;t have to make a latticed top for this pie, but you can if you like. Here&#8217;s how:</span><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/berry-pie-lattice-1.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="pie crust dough cut into strips to make a lattice crust" width="620" border="0" /><br /></span><span class="s1"><strong>Step one</strong>: Roll the pie dough top crust out into a 12 x 12  shape and cut into 1-inch thick strips (pictured above). Go for more of a square shape if possible.<br /><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/berry-pie-lattice-2.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="pie crust dough strips being woven into a lattice pie crust" width="620" border="0" /><br /></span><span class="s1"><strong>Step two</strong>: Arrange 6-7 strips horizontally on a piece of parchment paper. Then, starting in the middle, working quickly with a single strip, make your strips look like this. (above) Under two, over two, under two, at 45 degree angle.<br /><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/berry-pie-lattice-3.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="complete lattice pie crust top ready to be placed on pie before baking" width="620" border="0" /><br /></span><span class="s1"><strong>Step three</strong>: Grab another single strip and do the opposite next door. So &#8211; over two, under two, over two. Keep going working outward, alternating. When you&#8217;ve used all your strips transfer the crust to the refrigerator for 5 minutes or so to set a bit. You&#8217;ll be able to slide it off the parchment paper into place on the pie. Trim just beyond the edge of the pie dish, crimp or seal, and proceed with the recipe.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span class="s1">This is baby fennel, giant beans (Greek gigante beans), sliced lemon, a honey-kissed, in-pan, white wine sauce, all finished with a shower of chopped dill. If any of you are in a side-dish rut, I&#8217;m going to lobby for trying this. It&#8217;s fast, it&#8217;s good, and as a base idea, it&#8217;s flexible. You can make the beans as instructed below, or use the recipe as a jumping off point.<br /><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/lemon-gigante-beans-v2.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="gigante beans cooked with fennel and herbs in a serving dish" width="620" border="0" /></span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Lemon Gigante Beans: Variations</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are a lot of ways to tweak this recipe idea. There are also a bunch of great suggestions down in the comments as well!</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">When made in an oven-proof skillet, top it with feta, chopped olives, and breadcrumbs, and bake into a crunchy-topped gratin.</span></li>
<li class="p1">Add a poached egg on top of each serving to make a complete one bowl meal.</li>
<li class="p1">Add a few cups of water (or herby broth), season well, and you have a bright, substantial stew.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Giant Beans: Favorite Sources</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Greek gigante beans can be challenging to source in local stores. I tend to stock up ( with a few bags) when finding them, or order, in bulk, on line. </span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p3"><a href="https://anthosfoods.com/collections/greek-pulses/products/arosis-greek-giant-beans-400gr">Arosis Gigante Beans</a>: Keep an eye out for the organic version of these as well.</li>
<li class="p3">Rancho Gordo <a href="https://www.ranchogordo.com/products/royal-corona-bean">Royal Corona Beans</a>: These are a fantastic substitute for Greek gigandes. Comparable in size, they’re often a bit creamier.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This salt and pepper tofu is something you can use as a component in all sorts of meals. It’s great in salads, tossed with noodles, or served over grain bowls. Bonus: it’s simple to prepare, here&#8217;s how. Toss crumbled, extra-firm tofu with seasoned nutritional yeast to create a nice coating. Then pan-fry until deeply golden. You can enjoy it hot, but a long cool-down in the refrigerator really dials in the texture and flavor. There are a lot of Chinese-inspired salt and pepper tofu recipes out there. Just know, this is not that. This is something different &#8211; more like a tasty health store hippie tofu, or a delicious tofu-based chicken alternative. Can’t get enough of it over here.<br /><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/salt-and-pepper-tofu-1.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="salt and pepper tofu in a bowl" width="620" border="0" /></p>
<h2 class="p1">Salt and Pepper Tofu: Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>
<p class="p1">There are a few things to pay attention if you want the best results for this recipe:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Tofu</strong>: Seek out extra-firm tofu. You’re going to freeze it overnight, or for at least 5 hours, so plan ahead. After thawing you press as much liquid as possible from the tofu. This is going to be the key to getting the dense, substantial texture in the end.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Black Pepper</strong>:<span class="Apple-converted-space" style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Black pepper steps up in this recipe, so it’s worth it to use the good stuff. The difference between old, dusty, pre-ground black pepper, and good, well-sourced freshly ground peppercorns is WILD. If you’re not excited about black pepper, it’s time to turn things around. I really love <a href="https://yupanquipepper.com/product-category/bags/">Yupanqui Black Imperial peppercorns</a> from Ecuador, and consequently go through <em>a lot</em> of it. But there are many, many other amazing, interesting black peppers to explore as well:</span><span class="Apple-converted-space" style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"><a href="https://www.diasporaco.com/products/aranya-black-pepper">Diaspora</a>, <a href="https://sos-chefs.com/collections/peppercorns">SOS Chefs</a>, <a href="https://www.burlapandbarrel.com/collections/peppercorns">Burlap &amp; Barrel</a>. And if you’re ready to geek out on the pepper front even more, Andrea Nguyen wrote about Vietnamese peppercorns <a href="https://www.vietworldkitchen.com/blog/2018/04/vietnamese-pepper.html">here</a>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/salt-and-pepper-tofu-3.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="salt and pepper tofu in a large bowl with salad ingredients like ramen noodles, shredded lettuce and carrots" width="620" border="0" /></p>
<h2 class="p1">Salt and Pepper Tofu: How to Serve It</h2>
<p class="p1">Salt and pepper tofu is great for snacking. I never make it with that as the intention, but I can&#8217;t help but grab a few bites here and there. It is good for a few days, refrigerated, after cooking. Here are a few favorite ways to enjoy it.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>In Salads</strong>: You can see in the photos here, salt and pepper tofu is an ideal salad component. You can serve it on top, or toss it with other ingredients and dressing. Here we had it in a big ol’ lunch salad with just about everything I could grab &#8211; shredded red cabbage and carrots, lettuces, pistachios, avocado, toasted ramen noodles, cherry tomatoes, celery, kidney beans, and a spicy sesame dressing. An all <a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/raw-tuscan-kale-salad/">kale salad</a> version is also A-plus.<br /><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/salt-and-pepper-tofu-2.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="salt and pepper tofu in a large bowl with salad ingredients like ramen noodles, shredded lettuce and carrots" width="620" border="0" /></li>
<li class="p1"><strong>In a bento</strong>: As part of my feel-good <a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/feel-good-lunch-ideas/">lunch ideas</a>, this fits right in. Some salt &amp; pepper tofu alongside a tangle of noodles, plus one or two of the salad or veg options on that page is ideal.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Rice Bowl</strong>: It’s a great rice (or other grain) bowl component. A brown rice base topped with the tofu, some creamy avocado, and some sort of shredded salad, veg, or slaw component is the way to go. Paired with a favorite thin sauce or dressing. Something not far from this <a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/kale-rice-bowl/">rice bowl</a> or this <a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/sushi-bowl-recipe/">sushi bowl</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="s1">This roasted broccoli dinner is all about easy adaptability. Broccoli, tossed in a bit of spiced olive oil is roasted in a blistering hot oven. A creamy, tahini under-dressing is smeared generously across your serving platter. Everything is finished with magic mix of basil, peanuts, dried fruit, and scallions. Mark my words, people can’t get enough of it.<br /><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/roasted-broccoli-v.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="roasted broccoli on a serving plate" width="620" border="0" /><br /></span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Why This Roasted Broccoli is So Good</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the magic elements of this recipe is the pop of sweetness you get from using a bit of roasted dried fruit. So resist skipping out on the fruit. Seriously. I like using golden raisins because they plump up, ooze a bit of sugary juice, and then caramelize where the juice hits the baking sheet. But if sourcing them is a challenge, just go for chopped dried apricots, or chopped dates. It all comes off one sheet pan, plated on a single, family-style platter.</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Inspiration: </span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><a href="https://www.alisoneroman.com/">Alison Roman</a></span><span class="s1"> has a brilliant version in her <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/dining-in-highly-cookable-recipes-a-cookbook-alison-roman/11165505"><span class="s2">Dining In</span></a> cookbook using cauliflower florets and dates. That was my starting point months ago, and this is where we ended up. A greened up third cousin of sorts.<br /><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/roasted-broccoli-2.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="roasted broccoli on a table for dinner" width="620" border="0" /><br /></span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">More Variations</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Caramelized and deeply-roasted broccoli is my favorite vegetable angle here, but don&#8217;t limit yourself. Other Ideas:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Cauliflower:</strong> As mentioned above, Alison’s version uses cauliflower.</span></li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Brussels Sprouts:</strong> Feathery leaves of Brussels sprouts make another great alternate, I like to shred them.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Mixed Vegetables:</strong> Can’t decide? Do a mix of vegetables (the blend in the photo is mostly broccolini with a few handfuls of shredded brussels sprouts).<br /><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/roasted-broccoli-5.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="broccoli on a sheet pan after baking" width="620" border="0" /></li>
<li class="p1"><strong>No tahini?</strong> Almond butter or sunflower seed butter work nicely as well. A completely different direction is to mix a bit of salt into yogurt, spice it up a bit.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/roasted-broccoli-4.jpg?w=620&amp;auto=format" alt="roasted broccoli along with noodles and fork on a table for dinner" width="620" border="0" /><br />Roasted Broccoli Dinner</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You can see (above) I serve the broccoli platter alongside simple soba noodles tossed with a splash of olive oil, seasoned with a pinch of salt, and sprinkled with a mix of seeds. I boil the soba noodles while the vegetables are roasting, and it makes for a nice meal.</span></p>
