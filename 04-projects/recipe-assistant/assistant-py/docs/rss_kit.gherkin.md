# Gherkin Instructions for RSS Module Development (Composition-based)

## Feature: RSS Feed List

rss_functions.py

```gherkin
Feature: RSS Feed List
  As a developer
  I want to have a list of RSS feeds in JSON format
  So that I can easily manage and iterate through them

  Scenario: Create initial RSS feed list
    Given I have a list of 40 food blog RSS feeds
    When I create a JSON file named "rss_feeds.json" in the /data directory
    Then the file should contain an array of feed objects
    And each feed object should have "name" and "url" properties

  Scenario: Add a new RSS feed to the list
    Given the "rss_feeds.json" file exists
    When I add a new feed with name "New Food Blog" and URL "https://newfoodblog.com/feed"
    Then the "rss_feeds.json" file should be updated
    And it should include the new feed in the array

  Scenario: Remove an RSS feed from the list
    Given the "rss_feeds.json" file exists
    When I remove the feed with name "Outdated Food Blog"
    Then the "rss_feeds.json" file should be updated
    And it should not include the removed feed in the array
```

## Feature: RSS Module Functions

```gherkin
Feature: RSS Module Functions
  As a developer
  I want to have a set of functions that can process RSS feeds
  So that I can extract recipe information from multiple sources using a composition-based approach

  Scenario: Create RSS module functions
    Given I have a Python development environment
    When I create a new file named "rss_functions.py"
    Then the file should contain separate functions for RSS processing tasks

  Scenario: Load RSS feed list
    Given the "rss_feeds.json" file exists
    When I call the load_feed_list function
    Then it should return a list of feed objects from the JSON file

  Scenario: Fetch RSS feed content
    Given I have a feed object with a URL
    When I call the fetch_feed_content function with the feed object
    Then the function should return the raw XML content of the feed

  Scenario: Parse RSS feed content
    Given I have raw XML content from an RSS feed
    When I call the parse_feed_content function with the XML content
    Then it should return a list of recipe entries
    And each entry should have basic metadata (title, link, published date)

Following best practices, write the function and test in rss_functions.py

  Scenario: Process single RSS feed
    Given I have a rss_data
    When I call the read_feed_object function with the feed data
    Then it should fetch and parse content for that feed
    And create a feed_object

  Scenario: Process single RSS feed
    Given I have a feed object
    When I call the process_single_feed function with the feed object
    Then it should fetch and parse content for that feed
    And return a list of recipe entries from that feed

  Scenario: Process all RSS feeds
    Given I have a list of feed objects
    When I call the process_all_feeds function with the list
    Then it should process each feed
    And return a combined list of recipe entries from all feeds

  Scenario: Handle feed retrieval errors
    Given a feed URL is invalid or unreachable
    When the fetch_feed_content function is called with this feed
    Then it should return an error indicator
    And log the error for later review

  Scenario: Filter recipes based on preferences
    Given I have a list of processed recipe entries
    And I have a set of preference criteria as a function
    When I call the filter_recipes function with the entries and criteria
    Then it should return a list of recipes matching the criteria
```

This updated Gherkin specification outlines the structure and functionality for creating an RSS feed list and a set of RSS processing functions using a composition-based approach. It covers scenarios for managing the feed list, creating individual functions for RSS processing tasks, and applying basic filtering.

The main differences from the class-based approach are:

1. Instead of a `RSSProcessor` class, we now have individual functions for each task.
2. The `process_single_feed` and `process_all_feeds` functions compose other functions to achieve their goals.
3. The state is not maintained within a class; instead, it's passed between functions as needed.

This approach allows for more flexibility and easier testing of individual components. It also aligns well with functional programming principles, which can lead to more modular and reusable code.
