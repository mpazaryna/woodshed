# Feature: AI-Powered Recipe Metadata Extractor and Smart Filter

As a food enthusiast I want to efficiently process and analyze recipes from multiple RSS feeds
So that I can discover and organize recipes that align with my preferences

## Scenario: Fetching and Processing RSS Feeds

Given I have a list of 40 food blog RSS feed URLs
When I run the RSS feed fetcher
Then it should retrieve the latest posts from all feeds
And extract the recipe content from each post

## Scenario: Extracting Recipe Metadata using LLM

Given I have extracted recipe content from an RSS feed
When I process the content through the LLM
Then it should extract the following metadata:
  | Metadata Field   |
  | Title            |
  | Main Ingredients |
  | Cuisine Type     |
  | Cooking Method   |
And return the metadata in a structured format

## Scenario: Categorizing Recipes

Given I have extracted metadata for a recipe
When I pass the metadata to the LLM for categorization
Then it should assign the recipe to one of the following categories:
  | Category      |
  | Quick and Easy|
  | Vegetarian    |
  | Gluten-Free   |
  | Comfort Food  |
  | Healthy       |
  | Gourmet       |

## Scenario: Prioritizing Recipes Based on User Preferences

Given I have set my ingredient preferences
  | Ingredient | Priority |
  | Black Beans| High     |
  | Steak      | Low      |
When the system processes a new recipe
Then it should adjust the recipe's priority based on my preferences

## Scenario: Storing Processed Recipe Data

Given I have extracted and categorized recipe data
When I store the data
Then it should be saved in a JSON format
And include all extracted metadata and assigned categories

## Scenario: Generating Insights and Analytics

Given I have a collection of processed recipes
When I request analytics
Then the system should provide insights on:
  | Insight Type           |
  | Cuisine Type Trends    |
  | Ingredient Frequencies |
  | Cooking Method Usage   |

## Scenario: CLI Interface for Recipe Management

Given I have the recipe processing system set up
When I use the CLI interface
Then I should be able to:
  | Action                              |
  | Fetch and process new RSS feed data |
  | View processed recipes              |
  | Filter recipes by category          |
  | Update ingredient preferences       |
  | Generate and view analytics         |

## Scenario: Integration with Mela Recipe Manager

Given I have processed and stored recipe data
When I select a recipe for export to Mela
Then the system should generate a Mela-compatible link in the format:
  """
  mela://calendar/[ID]/[SOURCE]/[DATE]/[SLUG]
  """
And allow me to add the recipe to my Mela collection

## Scenario: Handling Multiple Data Storage Options

Given I have processed recipe data
When I choose a data storage option
Then the system should use a factory method to:
  | Storage Option |
  | JSON files     |
  | Database       |
  | Vector Store   |
And store the data accordingly

## Scenario: Scalability and Performance

Given the system is processing 40 RSS feeds
When new feed data is available
Then it should process all feeds within a reasonable time frame
And handle any network or parsing errors gracefully
