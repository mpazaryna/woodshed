# Gherkin Instructions for RSS Module Development (Composition-based)

Functional code, not a class

## Feature: File Operations

```gherkin
Feature: File Operations
  As a developer
  I want to have functions to handle file operations
  So that I can easily read and write data files in the project

  Scenario: Read file from data directory
    Given there is a "/data" directory in the project
    And there is a file named "example.json" in the "/data" directory
    When I call the read_file_from_data_directory function with "example.json" as the argument
    Then the function should return the contents of the file
    And the contents should be in the appropriate format (e.g., JSON parsed if it's a JSON file)

  Scenario: Handle non-existent file
    Given there is a "/data" directory in the project
    And there is no file named "non_existent.json" in the "/data" directory
    When I call the read_file_from_data_directory function with "non_existent.json" as the argument
    Then the function should raise a FileNotFoundError
    And an appropriate error message should be logged

  Scenario: Handle empty file
    Given there is a "/data" directory in the project
    And there is an empty file named "empty.json" in the "/data" directory
    When I call the read_file_from_data_directory function with "empty.json" as the argument
    Then the function should return an empty result (e.g., an empty dict for JSON files)
    And a warning should be logged about the empty file

  Scenario: Read RSS feed list from data directory
    Given there is a "/data" directory in the project
    And there is a file named "rss_feeds.json" in the "/data" directory
    When I call the read_file_from_data_directory function with "rss_feeds.json" as the argument
    Then the function should return the list of RSS feeds
    And each feed in the list should have "name" and "url" properties
