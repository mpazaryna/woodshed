# TypeScript to Go Conversion Notes

This document outlines the key points of converting the `recipe_insights` module from TypeScript to Go.

## Main Changes

1. **Package Structure**: The main functionality is now in a package called `main`. Consider changing this to a more specific package name for larger applications.

2. **OpenAI API Interaction**: We're using the `github.com/sashabaranov/go-openai` package for OpenAI API interactions. Install it with:
   ```
   go get github.com/sashabaranov/go-openai
   ```

3. **Logging**: Logging now uses Go's built-in `log` package. The log file is opened in the `init()` function.

4. **Error Handling**: Error handling is more explicit in Go. The `GenerateInsights` function now returns an error as its second return value.

5. **API Key**: The OpenAI API key is expected to be in an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

6. **Testing**: Tests now use Go's built-in testing package. The structure is similar to the TypeScript version, but the assertion style is different.

7. **Type Conversion**: TypeScript's `Record<string, string>` type is replaced with Go's `map[string]string`.

## Usage Notes

- Handle errors appropriately when calling `GenerateInsights` in your application code.
- Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable before running the program.
- Run tests using the `go test` command in the directory containing the Go files.

## Further Considerations

- Adjust the package name if integrating into a larger Go application.
- Review and adjust error handling and logging as needed for your specific use case.
- Consider adding more comprehensive error messages and handling for production use.
