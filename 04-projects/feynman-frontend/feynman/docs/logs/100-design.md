## GHERKIN SCENARIOS

```gherkin
Feature: Voice Learning Session

Scenario: Starting a New Learning Session
  Given the user has opened the application
  When they select "New Session"
  Then the system should initialize recording capability
  And display the session timer
  And enable the voice input

Scenario: Recording an Explanation
  Given the user is in an active session
  When they press the record button
  Then the system should begin voice recording
  And show real-time transcription
  And indicate recording status

Scenario: Completing an Explanation
  Given the user is recording
  When they press stop
  Then the system should end the recording
  And process the transcription
  And initiate the analysis phase

Scenario: Receiving Analysis
  Given the explanation is complete
  When the analysis is finished
  Then the system should display:
    | Clarity score        |
    | Simplicity measure   |
    | Completeness rating  |
    | Improvement areas    |

Scenario: Saving Session Results
  Given the analysis is complete
  When the user selects "Save Session"
  Then the system should store:
    | Recording          |
    | Transcription     |
    | Analysis results  |
    | Session metadata  |

Scenario: Reviewing Past Sessions
  Given the user has saved sessions
  When they access "Session History"
  Then they should see:
    | Session date      |
    | Topic            |
    | Performance metrics |
    | Improvement trend   |
```
