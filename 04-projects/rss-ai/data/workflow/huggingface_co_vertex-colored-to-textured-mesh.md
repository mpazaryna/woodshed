- Vertex colors are a simple way to add color information to a mesh's vertices, but most applications prefer UV-mapped, textured meshes.
- The tutorial provides a quick solution to convert vertex-colored meshes to UV-mapped, textured meshes using the InstantTexture library.
- The process involves installing dependencies, generating UV maps, filling textures, and refining the texture for a smoother appearance.
