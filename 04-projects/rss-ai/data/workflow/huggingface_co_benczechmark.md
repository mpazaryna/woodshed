- The BenCzechMark is an evaluation suite designed to test the abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the Czech language through tasks like reasoning, information extraction, and language modeling.
- The suite consists of 50 tasks across 9 categories with native content, and includes tasks such as Reading Comprehension, Factual Knowledge, and Math Reasoning in Czech.
- Models are evaluated using a unique scoring mechanism called duel scoring, where model performances are compared statistically across tasks to determine an aggregate score, leading to a leaderboard where the Llama-450B model emerged as the top-performer.
