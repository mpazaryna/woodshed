- Community Tools feature has been introduced on HuggingChat, which allows users to convert any Space they love on HuggingFace into a tool for models to use directly on HuggingChat. This feature expands the modalities available on HuggingChat, enabling users to create tools for images, videos, text-to-speech models, and more.
- Users can create community tools by turning a public Space into a tool, creating custom tools themselves, enhancing assistants with community tools, and creating RAG tools for their own documents.
- Through this feature, users can improve their conversations with multimodal content and custom tools, and provide feedback to HuggingFace on unsupported Spaces or tools that are not working as expected.
