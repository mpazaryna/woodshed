# Development Insight: Custom Exception Classes and the 'pass' Statement

## Context

In our JSON utility module, we needed to implement error handling for various JSON processing scenarios. We wanted to create a custom exception that would allow us to distinguish JSON-related errors from other types of exceptions in our codebase.

## Decision

We decided to create a custom exception class called `JSONProcessingError` that inherits from the built-in `Exception` class. We implemented this class using a minimal definition that includes only a docstring and the `pass` statement.

## Rationale

The decision to create a custom exception class and use the `pass` statement was based on several factors:

1. **Custom Exception Types**: Creating a custom exception allows us to have more granular control over error handling in our application. By having a specific `JSONProcessingError`, we can catch and handle JSON-related errors separately from other types of exceptions.

2. **Inheritance from Exception**: By inheriting from the built-in `Exception` class, our custom exception automatically gains all the standard exception behavior. This includes the ability to be raised, caught, and to carry an error message.

3. **Minimal Implementation**: The use of `pass` allows us to create a functional custom exception with minimal code. This adheres to the principle of YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It), as we don't add any unnecessary complexity to our exception class.

4. **Readability and Maintainability**: A simple custom exception class improves code readability by making it clear when JSON-specific errors occur. It also enhances maintainability by centralizing JSON error handling.

5. **Extensibility**: While our current implementation is minimal, the custom class gives us the flexibility to add more specific behavior in the future if needed, without changing the interface that other parts of the code use to interact with this exception.

Here's the implementation we chose:

```python
class JSONProcessingError(Exception):
    """Custom exception class for JSON processing errors."""
    pass
```

This implementation works because:

- It inherits all necessary functionality from the `Exception` class.
- The docstring provides a clear description of the exception's purpose.
- The `pass` statement allows the class to be defined without any additional custom behavior.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Using Built-in Exceptions**: We could have used built-in exceptions like `ValueError` or `RuntimeError`. However, this would have made it harder to distinguish JSON-specific errors from other types of errors in our error handling code.

2. **More Complex Custom Exception**: We could have implemented a more complex custom exception with additional attributes or methods. For example:

   ```python
   class JSONProcessingError(Exception):
       def __init__(self, message, json_data):
           super().__init__(message)
           self.json_data = json_data
   ```

   While this would allow us to include the problematic JSON data with the exception, it was deemed unnecessary for our current needs and would violate the YAGNI principle.

3. **Empty Class Definition**: We could have omitted the `pass` statement entirely:

   ```python
   class JSONProcessingError(Exception):
       """Custom exception class for JSON processing errors."""
   ```

   This would work identically to our chosen implementation. We chose to include `pass` for explicit clarity, especially for developers who might be less familiar with Python's syntax.

## Implications

1. **Error Handling**: Parts of our codebase that interact with the JSON utility module can now catch `JSONProcessingError` specifically, allowing for more precise error handling.

2. **Logging and Debugging**: When `JSONProcessingError` is raised, it will be clear in logs and stack traces that the error is specifically related to JSON processing.

3. **Future Development**: If we need to add specific behavior to our JSON error handling in the future, we have a clear place to do so by expanding the `JSONProcessingError` class.

4. **Code Review**: Team members reviewing code can easily identify where JSON-specific error handling is occurring by looking for this custom exception.
