# Yoga Sequence Generator for Senior Teachers: Project Plan

## Introduction

The Yoga Sequence Generator is a Python-based application designed to assist senior yoga teachers in creating, analyzing, and customizing yoga sequences for their classes. By leveraging an existing Airtable database of asanas, this tool aims to streamline the class planning process and ensure sequences are well-suited for senior practitioners.

## Project Overview

This application will allow yoga teachers to generate sequences based on specific parameters such as class duration, difficulty level, and focus areas. It will provide text-based outputs detailing pose names, durations, and key instructions, making it easy for teachers to use and share their sequences.

## Core Features

1. Airtable integration for asana data retrieval
2. Sequence generation algorithm
3. Customization options for senior practitioners
4. Text-based sequence output
5. Basic sequence analysis

## Development Approach

The project will be developed incrementally, following a milestone-based approach. This allows for clear progress tracking, manageable development phases, and the flexibility to adjust later milestones based on insights gained from earlier ones.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Project Bootstrapping

Establish connection with Airtable and implement data retrieval and parsing.

### Milestone 2: Data Integration

Establish connection with Airtable and implement data retrieval and parsing.

### Milestone 3: Basic Sequence Generation

Develop a simple algorithm to create yoga sequences based on basic parameters.

### Milestone 4: Command-Line Interface

Create a functional CLI for user input and sequence display.

### Milestone 5: Enhanced Sequence Customization

Improve sequence generation with options tailored for senior practitioners.

### Milestone 6: Sequence Analysis and Refinement

Implement basic analysis tools to evaluate and improve generated sequences.

## Timeline

Each milestone is estimated to take 1 day, with a total project duration of 6 days.

## Conclusion

This project plan outlines a structured approach to developing a valuable tool for senior yoga teachers. By following these milestones, we ensure a focused development process that delivers a functional application with room for future enhancements.
