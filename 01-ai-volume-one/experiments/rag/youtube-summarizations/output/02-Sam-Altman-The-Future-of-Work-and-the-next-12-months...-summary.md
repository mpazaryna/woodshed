The conversation on the "AI Ascent" podcast, hosted by Sam Alman and featuring guest Chad GPT from Seoia Capital, explored various topics related to Artificial Intelligence (AI). The discussion began with a question about how younger people use AI differently than older people.

According to Chad GPT, younger people tend to use AI in a more natural way, get better with it over time, and utilize it as an operating system. They are able to set up complex connections between AI systems and files, and often memorize intricate prompts. This natural usage of AI is attributed to the fact that younger individuals have fewer preconceived notions about the technology.

As mentioned by Sam Alman, this approach can be seen as impressive, particularly when it comes to users who can seamlessly integrate AI tools into their workflow. However, the question remains as to whether AI coding assistance should be considered a product or an integral part of what Chad GPT needs to be.

Chad GPT emphasized that "writing the parts that actually matter" is crucial in developing effective AI systems. He also stated that coding will become more central to the future of OpenAI, suggesting that this aspect will play a significant role in shaping the organization's direction.

The conversation also touched upon the idea of generational divides in AI adoption and the importance of rebuilding after setbacks. Sam Alman expressed disappointment with big companies' actions, while Chad GPT offered advice on managing crisis situations for founders.

Throughout the discussion, the topic of OpenAI coding tools and AI development was mentioned multiple times. Chad GPT emphasized the need to push forward and explore new avenues, stating that "if you push on those" ideas, the rest will sort itself out.

The conversation concluded by highlighting the significance of learning from personal experience and practice in the field of AI development.
