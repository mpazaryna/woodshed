## Summary
The conversation begins with Thing introducing his guest, Liz Havier Bruinsa, and discussing their plans to start a gallery. They started thinking about it a year ago and have been reaching out to artists they know well and those they don't. Their idea is to start an apartment gallery in their home.

Their feeling is that people who collect art might enjoy seeing the gallery, as it's not a traditional setting. Thing mentions that he wishes he hadn't started this conversation because he doesn't know how to say his guest's last name, but ultimately decides to call him Rhett Bra. They discuss their first show, which is scheduled for June 2024.

Thing attended the gallery and met with Rhett Bra, who was closed at the time of Thing's visit. However, he later visited Blick Art Material, where he learned about regen projects in Hollywood. He also mentions being invited to a show by someone named Alex.

The conversation touches on various topics, including art, galleries, and artists. Thing seems enthusiastic about their project, but admits that starting it was a bit overwhelming due to his lack of knowledge on Rhett Bra's last name.
