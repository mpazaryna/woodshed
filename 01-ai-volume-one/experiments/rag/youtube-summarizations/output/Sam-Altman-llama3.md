Sam Alman recently appeared as a guest on the podcast "this show" hosted by The Host, which is part of Seoia Capital AI Ascent. During the conversation, Sam discussed the differences in AI adoption between older and younger people.

According to Sam, when a new technology emerges, younger people tend not to have preconceived notions about it, which enables them to use it in a more natural way. They are able to get better with it over time. However, what is particularly interesting is that younger people seem to be using AI as an operating system.

Sam shared some cool use cases of young people using TouchBT with AI, which might surprise us. He emphasized that these individuals use it like an operating system, showcasing their ability to leverage technology in a innovative manner.

In addition to discussing AI adoption among younger generations, Sam also touched on the evolution of life decisions and memory with AI assistance. He mentioned the importance of learning from experience and managing psychology after a crisis.

The conversation also highlighted the impact of technological advancement on people and companies. Sam expressed disappointment with big companies' actions, stating that it is like the difference between when the smartphone came out and every kid was able to use it super well and older people just took a few years to figure out how to do basic stuff.

Sam attributed this disparity to the way big companies approach challenges, saying "The hardest thing about the big challenges is not the moment they happen." He also emphasized the importance of practicing and getting better at dealing with adversity as a founder.

On a more specific note, Sam mentioned that coding will be more central to the future of open AI, particularly in terms of agents doing work. He noted that he expects significant progress in 2025, specifically in this area.

Overall, the conversation highlighted the differences in AI adoption among younger and older generations, as well as the importance of learning from experience and managing psychology after a crisis. Sam also provided insight into the potential future of industry development and the role of coding in driving innovation in open AI.
