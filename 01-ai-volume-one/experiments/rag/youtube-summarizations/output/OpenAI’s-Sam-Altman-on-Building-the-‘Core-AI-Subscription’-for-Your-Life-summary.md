## 02:02 Milestones and Evolution of Language Models

> ""Well, we got to build a system to see if it's working. And we're not just writing research papers. So, we're going to see if we can play a video.""

The guest discusses the milestones of developing consumer products, highlighting that Dolly, rather than CHACT, was the first consumer product milestone. The development involved experimenting with various directions before focusing on building a system to validate the technology through practical applications such as playing video games and creating robot hands. Eventually, the team realized they needed more funding to scale their billion-dollar model projects beyond pure science experiments. This realization led them to explore ways to commercialize these models, realizing that making something much easier to use typically provides significant benefits. The guest also notes that API products usually work well across many companies, supporting the idea that they should focus on improving usability and creating business opportunities for their technology.

### Takeaways

* The first consumer product milestone was Dolly, not CHACT.
* Initial development involved experimenting with various directions before focusing on building a system to validate the technology through practical applications like playing video games and creating robot hands.

## 04:02 GPT3 API Usage and ChatGPT Development

> "And it was terrible at chat. We had not at that point figured out how to do RHF to make it easy to chat with, but people loved to do it anyway."

GPT3, released by OpenAI in June 2020, received little public attention outside of Silicon Valley despite being made available as an API. While a few companies leveraged GPT3 for copyrighting services, the majority of the world showed no interest. However, people's enthusiasm for interacting with the model through the playground indicated potential for more engaging applications. This led to the development of ChatGPT, which capitalized on this interest in conversational interaction. By the time ChatGPT 3.5 was released, there were eight categories where businesses could build APIs based on the model, reflecting a shift towards recognizing its broader utility beyond simple text generation tasks.

### Takeaways

* GPT3 was initially released in June 2020 but received little public attention outside of Silicon Valley.
* The primary early use of GPT3 API was for copyrighting services, which barely scratched the economic surface.
* People's interest in interacting with the model through the playground indicated potential for chat functionality, leading to the development of ChatGPT.

## 29:40 Resilience and Founder Psychology

> ""Um it gets easier over time. I think Um it gets easier over time. I think""

The transcript discusses resilience and challenges faced by founders of startups. According to the conversation, resilience tends to improve over time as founders encounter more adversity. The speaker notes that while acute crises can be managed with support and adrenaline, long-term recovery involves picking up the pieces after a crisis, which is often overlooked in discussions. They emphasize that the biggest challenge for founders lies in managing their own psychology during the aftermath of a crisis rather than dealing with the immediate fallout. This perspective suggests that while initial challenges may feel insurmountable, they become easier to navigate as one gains experience. Additionally, the speaker implies that there is a lack of resources or guidance specifically addressing post-crisis recovery and psychological resilience for founders.

### Takeaways

* Resilience Improves Over Time as You Face More Adversity.
* The Biggest Challenge for Founders is Managing Their Psychology After a Crisis.
* Support and Adrenaline Help During Acute Crises, But Long-Term Recovery Requires Picking Up the Pieces.

## 31:36 Rebuilding Efforts Post-Crisis

> ""deal with the real crisis on day zero or day one or day two, but on day 60 as day one or day two""

The transcript segment emphasizes the importance of addressing crises as early as possible, ideally on day zero or one, rather than waiting until later stages such as day 60. The guest suggests that organizations and individuals can practice and improve their crisis management skills over time to handle emergencies more effectively. This approach underscores the idea that delaying effective response complicates recovery efforts significantly.

### Takeaways

* Crisis management should be addressed as soon as possible, ideally on day zero or one.
* Delaying effective crisis response until later stages (like day 60) complicates recovery efforts significantly.
