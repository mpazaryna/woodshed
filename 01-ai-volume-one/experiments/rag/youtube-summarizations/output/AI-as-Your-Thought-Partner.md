In this episode of Just Curious, host Jeremy Eli discusses the use of AI to unlock creative potential and foster innovation, drawing from his experiences as an adjunct professor at Stanford University and co-host of Beyond the Prompt with Henrik Verdlin.

Jeremy begins by sharing how he transitioned from being a professor on a world tour supporting his book to becoming a learner in the classroom. He explains, "And so instead of kind of going on the professorial world tour to support my book, I basically made a decision to strap myself into the front row of the classroom and become a learner so that I could help my students, my former and current students, navigate how do they leverage this technology to suit their purpose of innovation."

Jeremy highlights the role of experimentation in innovation, noting his involvement with a group of CEOs called "explorers Junto," named after Ben Franklin's mechanism for sparking imagination. This group meets regularly to explore and share insights on AI as an area of exploration.

The conversation delves into how generative AI can be used effectively. Jeremy mentions playing around with GPT-3 during Thanksgiving week in 2022, which led him to explore the possibilities further: "And I started really putting some time. And I started really putting some time. And I started really putting some instructions into Chad GPT. It was just instructions into Chad GPT. It was just 3.5 and kind of blown away by what it could do, playing around in the sandbox."

Jeremy emphasizes that leaders must be at the forefront of AI adoption to ensure effective use within their organizations: "leaders have to be using it, right? So leaders have to be using it, right?" He also stresses the importance of demonstrating strategic use cases of AI for impact and efficiency. This includes building a culture where every employee uses AI daily in various functions.

During these discussions with CEOs, Jeremy noticed significant overlap between what AI suggested board members would ask and what they actually did ask: "The only way you can claim you're an AIdriven company is if three things. Every employee uses AI in every function every day." He notes the importance of leaders making inaction a punishable offense to drive action towards strategic use cases.

Jeremy discusses his work with a Japanese company to build capacity and enhance their AI strategy, highlighting the need for practical application over mere theory: "So, I'm working with this Japanese company to help them build capacity." He explains that the first step in becoming an AIdriven organization is simply starting to use AI: "The first I guess step for someone who comes to you and wants to become an AI first company or they want to design first company or they want to design this AI strategy to become a better this AI strategy to become a better company in the future than they are company in the future than they are today is just to start like using it."

The episode also covers the role of AI as a sparring partner and tool for problem-solving. Jeremy shares examples where he used generative AI, such as creating scenarios for difficult conversations: "I got a serious issue and I wonder if you got a serious issue and I wonder if you could help me." He demonstrates how leveraging AI can lead to more effective collaboration and innovation.

Throughout the discussion, Jeremy addresses common challenges in adopting AI, emphasizing the importance of imagination and creativity. He mentions the need for learning communities and groups to facilitate behavior change: "The point is even as and I hear this all the time from people. It's hear this all the time from people. It's hear this all the time from people. It's like the number of times I hear AI leaders and AI experts go, I was doing this for two hours before I hit my forehead and go, why am I not using AI?"

Jeremy concludes by emphasizing the value derived from technology use cases in various domains, including marketing, innovation, and problem-solving: "Open up Chad GPT and say, 'Hey, here's who I am. Here's what I'm trying to do. How could I leverage generative AI to do what I'm doing?'"

The episode provides a nuanced view of how AI can be integrated into daily work and business operations, highlighting the importance of practical application and strategic thinking in leveraging this technology for innovation and growth.
