The host, based in Thailand, discusses the topic of self-betrayal in an intimate and personal manner, drawing from their own experiences before entering monkhood. They describe how they have struggled with people-pleasing for almost their entire life, which manifested as a form of self-betrayal. The host explains that this pattern affected various aspects of their life, including personal struggles with conflict avoidance, dropping out of three PhD programs, and making decisions based on the desires and preferences of others.

The host elaborates on how betrayal in their life started subtly but gradually became more significant over time. They mention, "for me is I'm a people pleaser I don't want conflict," highlighting their initial inclination to avoid disagreement. This tendency led to situations where harmony was maintained at the expense of personal desires and needs.

During the discussion, the host shares that betrayal extended into romantic relationships, where they would do things just because their partner enjoyed them, often neglecting their own preferences and desires. They also mention feeling pressured to dress in specific ways to fit in with certain social circles, further illustrating the extent of their self-betrayal.

The host reflects on how, externally, their life appeared successful, but internally they felt disconnected from themselves. They describe this internal disconnect as a "game of Jenga" that began falling apart when they experienced a breakup after five years with their ex-girlfriend. This event was pivotal in revealing the extent of their self-betrayal and initiating the process of change.

To address these issues, the host decided to remove all distractions from their life, focusing on building a foundation for self-discovery. They emphasize the importance of taking time to understand one's values and what they truly want in life. The host shares, "all the noise and check in and I did," highlighting the practice of daily introspection as part of this process.

The host also discusses their journey toward self-awareness, noting that it was only when everything fell apart during the breakup that they were forced to re-evaluate their priorities. They describe the need for a personal anchor point, stating, "regardless of your situation make time to get to know you," and explaining that this process involved daily meditation practice.

Through consistent self-reflection and small decisions, the host gradually built trust in themselves, eventually trusting themselves with bigger choices. The host concludes by encouraging others to take responsibility for their own choices and to prioritize getting to know themselves better: "if you do not have a anchor point when you have to make decisions you're going to rely on your outside environment." They also advise that it is okay to acknowledge the influence of others but that eventually, one must take control of their life.
