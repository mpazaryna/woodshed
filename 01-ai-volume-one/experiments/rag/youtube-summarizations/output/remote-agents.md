## Summary
**Summary**

The video transcript introduces "Remote Agents" from Augment Code, a tool designed to handle complex tasks in large code bases. The main idea is that remote agents can work in the background while the developer is away, allowing for increased productivity and efficiency. The speaker highlights the benefits of remote agents, including the ability to tackle multiple tasks simultaneously and provide a fully accessible workspace for developers to assist when needed.

**Key Points**

* Remote Agents are designed to handle complex tasks in large code bases
* They can work in parallel and in the background with full context of the codebase
* Can edit files, run tests, push code, and perform other IDE agent functions
* Allow developers to steer, manage, and monitor their agents from any ID window
* Provide a fully accessible workspace for assistance when needed
* Enable 10x productivity gains from AI

**Detailed Overview**

The speaker starts by introducing Remote Agents as a tool designed to handle complex tasks in large code bases. They emphasize that remote agents can work independently, taking in large code bases and launching them with ease. The agent's capabilities are further expanded upon, highlighting its ability to launch multiple instances of itself to tackle various tasks simultaneously.

The speaker then shifts focus to the benefits of remote agents, explaining how they can help developers solve tickets and explore different solutions to hard problems. They also illustrate how remote agents can continue working on a long task while the developer is away, closing their laptop and heading to a meeting.

To provide more context, the speaker mentions that Augment Code has been thinking about agents from an applications development perspective. They acknowledge that in large-scale projects, there's often more work than what a team can reasonably handle, which is where remote agents come in. By running in parallel and with full context of the codebase, remote agents can perform tasks that would otherwise be time-consuming for human developers.

The speaker concludes by highlighting the key benefits of remote agents, including increased productivity, efficiency, and the ability to tackle multiple tasks simultaneously. They also emphasize how Augment Code has built tools to manage these agents, allowing developers to steer, manage, and monitor them from any ID window. The ultimate goal is to unlock 10x productivity gains from AI, which is achieved by leveraging remote agents in their full potential.

Finally, the speaker invites viewers to sign up for Augment Code to try Remote Agents for themselves, promising that they can see what developers build with this powerful tool.
