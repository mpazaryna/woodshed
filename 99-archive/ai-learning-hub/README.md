# Woodshed Research Hub

This repository serves as a central hub for cataloging and analyzing AI projects, frameworks, tools, and research papers. It's a part of my journey to master AI, focusing on exploring and learning from others' work.

## Structure

- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the entire research hub
- `projects/`: In-depth notes on specific projects
- `frameworks/`: Detailed explorations of frameworks
- `tools/`: Comprehensive reviews or guides for tools
- `papers/`: Extended analyses or implementations of paper concepts
- `courses/`: Detailed course notes, project write-ups, etc.

- `templates/`: Markdown templates for consistent note-taking

Each folder contains a README.md file providing an overview of its contents and usage guidelines.

## Usage

Each markdown file serves as a catalog for its respective category. When adding a new entry, include:

- Name/Title
- Link (if applicable)
- Brief description
- Personal notes on potential applications or interesting features
- Results of any tests or experiments run

For more detailed analyses or experiments, create a new markdown file in the `notes/` directory.

## Contributing

This is a personal research hub. While it's not open for direct contributions, feel free to fork this repository for your own AI learning journey.
