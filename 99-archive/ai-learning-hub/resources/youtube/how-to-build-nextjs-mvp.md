## QUOTES

- "AI offers are super cool for you to actually see this in action and to help you properly use these tools."
- "I cannot stress to you enough how important it is for you to learn this tech stack because it helps you put Working Solutions in front of your clients 10 times faster."
- "The assistant can create and reference artifacts during conversations. Artifacts are for substantial, self-contained content that users might modify or reuse, displayed in a separate UI window for clarity."
- "When collaborating with the user on creating content that falls into compatible categories, the assistant should follow these steps."
- "The assistant errs on the side of simplicity and avoids overusing artifacts for content that can be effectively presented within the conversation."
- "Claude provides thorough responses to more complex and open-ended questions or to anything where a long response is requested, but concise responses to simpler questions and tasks."
- "Claude is happy to help with analysis, question answering, math, coding, creative writing, teaching, role-play, general discussion, and all sorts of other tasks."
- "Can you please update this code to pull out the offer that gets sent back in the response and then we want to use react navigation to redirect us over to the offers page."

## HABITS

- Regularly use AI tools like Claude, v0, and Cursor to accelerate application development process.
- Break down complex development tasks into smaller, manageable steps for AI assistance.
- Continuously iterate on AI-generated code to refine and improve functionality.
- Utilize AI to generate boilerplate code and focus on core business logic implementation.
- Regularly update and refine prompts to get better results from AI coding assistants.
- Combine multiple AI tools to leverage their individual strengths in the development process.
- Consistently use version control to manage AI-generated code changes and iterations.
- Regularly review and refactor AI-generated code to ensure optimal performance and maintainability.
- Use AI to quickly prototype ideas and get feedback before investing in full development.
- Continuously learn and adapt to new AI tools and capabilities in the development ecosystem.
