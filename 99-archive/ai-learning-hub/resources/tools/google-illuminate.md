Illuminate is an experimental technology that uses AI to adapt content to your learning preferences. After you select one or more published papers, Illuminate will generate audio with two AI-generated voices in conversation, discussing the key points of the selected papers. Illuminate is currently optimized for published computer science academic papers.
