# AI Tools and Frameworks

This directory contains summaries and detailed explorations of various AI tools and frameworks used in my AI mastery journey.

## Contents

### LangChain

- **Summary**: [langchain.md](langchain.md)
- **Detailed Exploration**: [notes/tools/langchain-exploration.md](../notes/tools/langchain-exploration.md)

LangChain is an open-source development framework for building applications powered by language models.

<!-- Add more tools following the same pattern as they are explored -->

## Usage

- Each tool has a summary file (e.g., `toolname.md`) in this directory.
- Detailed explorations are stored in the `notes/tools/` directory.
- To add a new tool:
  1. Create a summary file in this directory.
  2. Add a detailed exploration in `notes/tools/`.
  3. Update this README with links to both files.
