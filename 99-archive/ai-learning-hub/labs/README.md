## Labs

The "labs" folder (stored separately from this repository) contains cloned projects and code examples that I'm actively studying and learning from. These are not my own projects, but rather excellent examples and references that contribute to my AI learning journey.

Process:

1. Interesting projects are cloned into the labs folder for exploration.
2. After studying a project, I document my learnings and insights in this woodshed-learning-hub.
3. References to explored projects can be found in relevant notes throughout this hub.

Note: The labs folder is not included in this repository to respect original project copyrights and to keep this hub focused on personal notes and learnings.
