## TERM FREQUENCY (TF)

Term Frequency measures how often a term appears in a document relative to its total number of terms. 

-- Analogy: If a document were a fruit basket, TF would be the count of how many apples are in the basket compared to the total number of fruits.

-- Why It Matters: It helps determine the significance of a word within a specific document, underlining its importance in that document's context.

## INVERSE DOCUMENT FREQUENCY (IDF)

Inverse Document Frequency assesses the importance of a term across a collection of documents or corpus by diminishing the weight of terms that occur very frequently and increasing the weight of terms that occur rarely.

-- Analogy: If every basket in a large collection mostly contains apples, then apples are less unique or significant; IDF would highlight the rarity of finding a mango across these baskets.

-- Why It Matters: IDF helps identify unique and significant words across multiple documents, making it easier to distinguish between them.

## CORPUS: 

A corpus is a large and structured set of texts that serves as a comprehensive collection for linguistic analysis.

-- Analogy: A library filled with books on various subjects can be seen as a corpus for someone studying languages.

-- Why It Matters: It provides the dataset upon which TF-IDF calculations are based, allowing for the analysis of the importance of terms across documents.

## PREPROCESSING: 

Preprocessing in text analysis involves cleaning and preparing text data for analysis by removing irrelevant items like URLs and special characters and standardizing word cases.

-- Analogy: Cleaning and cutting vegetables before cooking to ensure they cook evenly and taste good.

-- Why It Matters: It ensures that the analysis focuses on meaningful text data, improving the accuracy of TF-IDF calculations.

## LOGARITHM: 

In mathematics, a logarithm is an inverse operation to exponentiation, indicating how many times one number should be multiplied by itself to achieve another number. In IDF, logarithms help moderate the influence of term frequency across documents.

-- Analogy: If climbing a hill represents increasing term frequency, then using a logarithm is like adjusting the slope to make it easier or harder to increase its perceived height.

-- Why It Matters: It ensures that the IDF value grows slower, preventing terms appearing in slightly more documents from being overly penalized.

## SENTIMENT ANALYSIS: 

Sentiment analysis computationally identifies and categorizes opinions expressed in a text, especially to determine whether the writer's attitude towards a particular topic, product, etc., is positive, negative, or neutral.

-- Analogy: Listening to a friend's story about their day and determining if they had a good or bad day based on their words and tone.

-- Why It Matters: It allows for the automatic understanding of the sentiment behind tweets, which can be valuable for market research, political analysis, and social media monitoring.

## TOPIC MODELING: 

Topic modeling is a statistical method for discovering the abstract "topics" in a collection of documents.

-- Analogy: Sorting a pile of mixed fruit into groups based on type; each group represents a topic.

-- Why It Matters: It helps understand the underlying themes or topics within large volumes of text data, such as tweets, making organizing and summarizing information easier.
