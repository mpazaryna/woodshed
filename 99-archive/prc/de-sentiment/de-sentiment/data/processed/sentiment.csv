The DE MMJ dispensaries are still grossly overcharging patients. Compare the prices thesame companies charge at their franchises in other states to prove this.

"Watch out that the Recreational Market doesn't push out the Medical Patients. I watched ithappen in Boston. I worked at a dispensary during the Med only days up there. I also workedat that same dispensary when Rec sales opened up. This was very exciting and a huge win. Idon't think my organization anticipated that they would need to cut corners on production andreduce efficacy of products in order to meet the demand, especially from out of state patients.The out of state crowd won't be as large an issue due to the legalization in our neighboringstates, but profit motivation needs to be watched.

"In my opinion, medical cannabis can effectively treat many physical and mental healthconditions, yet as with any drug it should be used with knowledge and discretion, for thepatient's sake and those around them. Now that cannabis has been legalized in DE for adultuse my main concern would be the potential for abuse among those who are young orinexperienced regarding it's potency and psychoactive effects. The law enforcementcommunity will most likely benefit from an increase in dui and other criminal cases from thosewho are reckless enough to ""medicate"" before or while driving. In closing, I'd say thatrecreational cannabis is a bad thing for many people due to the potential for abuse/ accidents,any negative side effects that it may cause, and the fact that smoking and vaping areunhealthy regardless of substance.
