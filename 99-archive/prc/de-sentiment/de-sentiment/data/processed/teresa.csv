statement
The DE MMJ dispensaries are still grossly overcharging patients. Compare the prices thesame companies charge at their franchises in other states to prove this. Price per ounce hereremains between $300 and $500. It is routinely in the $100 to $150 range elsewhere. TheyMSO dispensaries are charging this outrageous amount simply because they can.
Almost allof the DE qualifying conditions are chronic—the renewal period should be 5 years.
"Watch out that the Recreational Market doesn't push out the Medical Patients. I watched ithappen in Boston. I worked at a dispensary during the Med only days up there. I also workedat that same dispensary when Rec sales opened up. This was very exciting and a huge win. Idon't think my organization anticipated that they would need to cut corners on production andreduce efficacy of products in order to meet the demand, especially from out of state patients.The out of state crowd won't be as large an issue due to the legalization in our neighboringstates, but profit motivation needs to be watched. Time will tell and I hope all the decisions aremade considering the health and wellness of all involved, not simply profit and programs andpolicy."
I am so appreciative that medical cards and dispensaries are available to those who need it.
Best health decision I've ever made with my doctor.
When will recreational marijuana be legalized in DE?


I like the medical system now.


Good


"I would like to see the medical program be separate from the adult use program. I don't thinkits right to tax medical marijuana like you would Adult usage marijuana. To me this is amedicine that takes away pain. I'm not using it to get high, although its a nice side effect. But,as an older person, taxing medical marijuana might make it too expensive for me topurchcase. It's already right up there, i.e. more expensive than purchasing out of statemarijuana from a legal state. But I like knowing that I'm getting my product from a companythat grows its own product and I know exactly what the levels of the types of terpines,limonenes, etc. that are in the product."


"I think medical cannabis patients would need a good reason to keep a medical card if it's legalfor all adults. Maybe cheaper cannabis, in Denver, some dispensaries have separate entrances[medical customers and adult use customers]."


I am very happy with the medical program. I feel safe and confident in all my purchases.


"many of these questions should have allowed multiple answers to be checked, this is not agood survey."


Medical marijuana has been a godsend for me as an MZL patient and as a long Covid survivor.


I research products and believe that Med weed is vital to my pain relief and sleep disorder


"I believe that the price is high, but the effects are worth it for the relief that it gives. Comparedto prescription drug prices, like Lyrica, medicinal marijauana is a lot more affordable."
Doctorsshouldn’t charge $200 for filling out the application and the state should consider a greatreduction for the submission of the application.


Having to renew every year is too much. It’s a real cost burden - $250/year to the doctor for a5 minute phone call. The doctors are making a killing off of patients who need this medication.


My Quality of life is much better with the use of cannabis!

MEDICAL MARIJUANA PATIENTS' VIEWS ON ADULT USE IN DELAWARE




I believe in adult use but until I have complete knowledge of the program I will stay withmedical. Medical provides all I need.


I'm glad to have a mm card as it helps my back.


More education and acceptance so that people to think it wrong or only for stoners. Weed hasa bad wrap





"This program is awesome as I cannot tell you how much this has helped me! Though, I amvery surprised with the cost of the medical card (I compare it to charging someone/patient justfor the right to buy a prescription at a pharmacy?!?!?) and the overall cost of the medication(AKA flower) is higher than can be purchased on the street."


I am glad that we have medical dispensaries. I notice that there are a lot of older patients andthat this helps eliminate taking medication that can eventually cause adverse reactions on ourbodies.


Cannabis should be regulated like cigarettes but cheaper


It would be great if medical users were covered by insurance.


I think it’s crazy that the federal government and insurance co will pay for all the opiates youwant but not medical marijuana. No overdose deaths no added issues of addiction andincreased health issues.


Please help keep us up to date on what's happening in the industry


RE: #28 I question the $11/gram. I must be going to the wrong dispensary because flower isabout $55 for 3.5 gram. (It was higher but has gone down a little.
RE: #29 I would support it aslong as selling to adult use folks didn't impact the supply for medical users. Medical usersshould have priority.


Medical Marijuana costs too much money





I’m worried about being able to access good product with having a qualifying condition andthere being adequate inventory at dispensaries with the new adult use legislation.


I'm nervous that the medical places will be overrun with recreational users.


Medical patients should be allowed to grow their own plants.


"I have had my card 2-3 years, but that wasnt an option to choose."
"Also, answers 25-29 are notaccurate nor valid since I don't know what adult use is, and you required an answer in order forme to submit this survey."


If you have a medical card then health insurance should cover


Thanks for your email.


Medical Marijuana has effectively treated my condition significantly changed my quality of life.


I will be happy when they take all legal restrictions off of medical cannabis for adults.


N/A


"i think some type of consuling should be made available about long term use effects and such.its all a trade off/balance, but education in that area would help"


I am very impressed with the professional staff at my local dispensary.


"Medical Marijuana has been a game changer for me. I have more than one severe conditionthat requires the use of pain medication. Since receiving my medical marijuana card, I havebeen able sleep at night."


"I would like to see the same strains that help me with my medical issues availableconsistently. Also I feel that the patients that have a medical card, pay less than recreationalusers."









I like knowing what I am getting as a safe product for my condition





"Authorization for medical patients to have Medicare/Medicaid pay for the cost of themedication would make this whole program work much better. Also, allowing patients to growtheir own, with regulatory inspection of allotted plants would make it perfect. Please considerallowing personal growing of plants for medical patients. Thank you."


"I believe most medical users know what helps them best. Most consultations with bud-tendersfor me have to with available inventory more than what benefits are to be had from theavailable inventory, if that makes sense."
"Also, I believe higher potency flower should bereserved for medical patients who may need high THC more than most adult users. The costof legal adult use cannabis might have to be lowered enough to compete with illegal cannabiswhich can be obtained for less than half of medical cannabis, albeit at the cost of diminishedquality control."
"Thanks for the survey. For me, question 15 was the most thought-provoking."


I'm happy that DE is making marijuana use legal.


all ok


I have many more questions about adult use.


"It's a good thing 4 people with conditions and recreational is good also ,people will drink lessnoone ever was killed by smoking, police smoke also they need to chill"


CBD has helped my pain decrease more than anything else .


I use the oils


The price the doctor charges to sign paperwork is expensive when you are on a budget or justdon’t have 75 to 200 is an additional hardship.


"Since using on the regular, I sleep better with less emphasis on trying to fall asleep. Hardlyany disruptive thoughts to my day or plan of the day."


NA


Do not combine DE Driver’s License with Medical Marijuana Card.


None


I would not be able to eat without medical cannabis. I hope that medical takes priority overrecreational use.


"The only people again that can afford to open a weed shop are the rich, it’s ridiculously overpriced, they are crooks, pharmaceutical crooks."


N/A


N/A


I hope the price of medical marijuana comes down as legal weed becomes more available herein Delaware


None


Cheaper prices or i wish insurance covered it.


I think alcohol use is worse or can be worse than medical weed.


"I agree with having a card with a qualifying condition, at any age. If it helps with your condition/mental or physical."


Medical patients should have a lower price for the marijuana they buy or any substance withThc . There needs to be priority for the medical patients over recreational users.


I will continue to apply for the MMC and purchase the tinctures that are beneficial to me.


I would like to see if participants can grow their marijuana by buying seeds for planting.






Lower Prices


"Because adult use will be coming in the future, it would be nice if the qualifying conditions formedical use would include more conditions. Also, many people with qualifying conditions havevery limited income, prices are high so it makes it very hard to afford the medication. PLEASEmake it more affordable!"


N/A


"Delaware's edible potency is awful. I don't use edibles because they are so weak, but woulduse them if Delaware allowed them to be stronger."


"The Farm in Felton, DE is the best."


I would like there to be specifically labelled and easily distinguished organic cannabis. I believeA LOT of non organic fertilizers are used in all cannabis grown in Delaware.


CBD oil’s work.


Medical marijuana has been a life saver when it comes to having MS.


Medical Cannabis has helped me thru. my physical painful days


"I feel that medical marijuana is safer than alcohol. My concern with marijuana is, if notpurchased from a medical dispensary; it may be laced with deadly drugs. Persons under theage of 21 are buying marijuana illegally and I worry about them getting laced marijuana."


Be responsible ain't heard of no one dying of or for weed. Unless it was with other illegals.





Knowledge is the keystone to behavior change.





Delaware needs better selection and lower prices...if you can't do that I'll be getting my stufffrom Maryland.


I am grateful for the new laws but would like to keep my medical card. Thank you for all youdo!


"I go to Smyrna, DE & everyone there has been magnificent. I've never dealt w/ stuff like thisb4 so it's all new & they don't make me feel stupid for asking."


Delaware should have passed the legalization years ago …


As a medical use patient I prefer having our own provider or store. I'll all for adult rec use butthe places we go to now know about my disabilities and are vary set up to cater to the disabledcommunity and our needs which our more in depth than everyday adult rec users.


I’m hoping that the legalization of adult use cannabis will lead to more options at lower cost tomedical users.


I hope that medical use remains at the normal price


My hope is to have a location closer to my area of Sussex county. Lower Delaware. Thank You


I use medical marijuana for fibromyalgia. It helps immensely with chronic pain and sleepissues.


I am a reserved user so all this is new to me. I just started using for the pain I have


Home grown needs to be added to our state. SUPPORT HOME GROWN PLANT COUNTS!!!!


I think the doctors asking for Hundreds of dollars for signing a medical patients card is a formof taking advatage of our pain since he already agreed it would help us instead of takingopioids which they dont charge a fee for.I think the state $50.00 fee is all we should have topay for besides the products we use for our pain.


No additional comments


Thank u and enjoy






Medical patients should be allow home grow where recreational should not. Medical cardsshould grant you the legal right to grow your own. We cannot afford the dispensary prices andstruggle to get what we need due to the high costs. Medicinal Marijuana in DE costs me morethan my insurance premiums and copays combined.


my condition has no cure; it’s is a crime that you make me requalify each year; like everyyear? it’s insulting and demeaning care. This is medicine to help people.


Please keep medical marijuana to lawful patients only - think of it as a medical conciergepractice.





The employees at the dispensary have been more friendly in the past year.


"My doctor put a negative report about my cannabis use in my portal. I thought he was happythat I was doing better with my pain. The medical professional are negative and only protectingtheir practice and the insurance company read those reports. In the future I will STOP tellingany doctor that I use cannabis. To conclude, Life insurance companies can turn me downbased on the above information. It's a *****show."


Medical Marijuana has helped me to control my life. Fewer panic attacks and anxiety attacks.I'm also more social.


It helps me greatly finally in my lifetime.


I am afraid that the medical quality will go down if Adult use is lumped in the same dispensary


No comment


"Let us grow our own, like other states, set a limit number of plants."


"I prefer to use TIKUN ""OR"" it worked the best for my pain. But I can no longer it in Delaware.They come out with all the new strains for the the people just doing it for recreation."
But do notkeep the stuff around that works for pain.
I do not understand that. 1 ouch would last me awhole year if I could get the one that actually works to get rid of my pain.. I do not buy a lotbecause 90% of it gives me a headache which defeats the purpose.


I’m still experimenting with it for pain management.





Each citizen should be able to grow 10 plants at their residence for personal use then tax it at$25 per plant one time fee





Dispensary prices are too high





thanks for all you do!








Bringing down the price of medical marijuana either through insurance coverage or chargingnon card holders more would be fantastic. Each of my 1 gram gap cartridges cost $100 withoutany discounts while my friend in Maine can buy the same exact stuff for half the cost of what Ipay.


I’m really happy with having my card very good product and assessable thank you


Paying $250 a year is insane. They have to bring these prices down. Why would anyone everpay that much if they we not forced to do so? It’s greed.


"I also use the cartridges, they are not color coded. I don’t want to make the mistake by usingsativa instead of Indica & vice versa"


I prefer lower THC levels and higher Terpenes






The cash requirement for payment is outdated and restrictive and can put buyers at risk forbeing robbed.


I like the variety but the flower is twice the price I can get on the street


"I do think the medical cost is a bit high, if it wasn’t for the sales I wouldn’t be able to afford. Iwould like to see medical cost go down a bit more especially because we have to pay thelicense fee. I think recreational should be what medical is now and medical should decrease."





The price is very high compared to the black market. It's extremely expensive. A quarter isdouble the price.


"The Columbia Care dispensary in Smyrna Delaware is where I go. They had a program calledadoptive family program! I was enrolled in it for 2 1/2 years and then all of a sudden in June1921 they had all new employees except maybe one or two and the new manager said I did notget my paperwork back in time. The manager that I've been there since the store opened in2019 used to sit down with me and help me fill it out because of my hands I can't write toogood anymore and it hurts to write. So there for I didn't qualify anymore! So I asked whybecause when I was enrolled in the program it was the employees of Columbia Care whoenrolled me in it because I would come in with change and only be able to buy a pre-roll I getdisability I have a lot of health issues such as lupus, Renaud's, Scleroderma, osteoporosis,atrial fib, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia. I have so many health issues!. It's just me and mygrandson and I have to pay all bills of course rent electric phone he air condition car insurance.It is such a hardship on my family to pay for it but I'm not sure what to do and if I even canpay for it anymore because it's putting me in a financial hole and I can't afford that as I said Iget disability the amount doesn't change every month! If there was a way for my insurance tocover it or I could get back into a program like that because I got an email from Cher well carewell which is the program that does the adopt a family and they told me that the program wasending so according to them I was still enrolled in this program but the new manager stoppedme from receiving the medication every month as I was getting. If someone could get back tome on this issue I would really appreciate it. I answered all your questions in your survey tothe best of my knowledge. Thank you! Sincerely, Doris Hawkins"


Had my medical card while living in Florida. There is a huge difference in Delaware the productis not as good (very dry) not the same varieties and the prices are almost twice as much thanflorida.





"I sincerely think this does help people, however, when you get the government involved,they’re good at one thing taxing people. So somehow we need to keep our government out of itbecause all they are trying to do is pad, their pocketbooks and get rich off the dumbasses thatwe are in Society."





"I’m thankful for the card - the products have really helped with my pain & assistance withsleep, as I have experienced insomnia."


"Medical cannabis has helped my anxiety better than the pill that was originally prescribed tome. I never want to go back to the pill, I’d rather keep the flowers."


www.CannabisCulture.com where it all came from and the reason it is legal today.


"After visiting states who have has legal marijuana for many years, I am excited too have thesame opportunity. Legalizing lends competition which means balanced pricing and betterproduct. My choices now are limited and are not even close to what I saw in other states andwhat I can get illegally."


I thank you very much this medication helped me a lot cut down on expenses like pills I hopeto continue YouTube


Delaware dispensary needs better quality flower


You should extend active medical cards til adult use goes into effect. A renewal for me is 200dollar doctors appointment and then the application fee…. All for what may be just a couple ofmonths…. It would nice to know I was covered.






Please do not mix the medical stores with the recreational stores.


"home delivery would be awesome, that would guarantee I would renew my card. if you have acard you can get weed delivered for free from dispensary or public location"


I want to continue to be able to buy medical marijuana without having restrictions. My doctorwill back me up on this. I’m trying to get off my one opioid medication.


I'm wondering why my parents doctors won't support the fact that they are in pain and are notallowed to smoke marijuana and ease their stress


I have never used my medical card. the prices are too high and the edibles are WAY too weak.I can buy from elsewhere and cut a 50mg gummy into 4 pieces if I choose too. Medicalmarijuana it ridiculously weak in the gummy category. it's just not worth it and I feel like Iwasted my money on getting a medical marijuana card...and there is extrememly limited variet.





Thank you. This stuff helps me be able to work and provide for my family. (PD)


"I hear in other states recreational marijuana is much more expensive than medical marijuana.Therefore, I intend to stick with medical marijuana."


"The only thing that truly concerns me about medical marijuana in Delaware is the cost, if thereis some way we can find to bring the cost down, the medical marijuana program in Delawarewould be perfect."








Medical marijuana is the only thing to help my pain. And I have tried everything before decidingto get my medical card!


My only concern is the availability of product. It seems to have been an issue with other stateswho have recreational cannabis


"I like to know that what I am getting is safe I use the tintures, edibles, and flowers. Movingaway from flowers to just tinctures and edibles"


my concerned is supply of the medical marijuana because demand is going to skyrocket


Thank you for this survey. I hope it benefits us Medical patients.
Thank you again


"I have liver failure and see a doctor from Jefferson University in Philadelphia. Medicalmarijuana is the only thing that has helped me. The doctor's there agree as well as thepsychologist. They are against smoking because of the mold spores that could be on flowerproducts. Unfortunately, I cannot check that on a label. My tolerance is super high because ofthe way the liver breaks it down. I would really like to be involved in a study. I have learned alot in the past few years and especially after my over a month long stay in the hospital atJefferson. It was very difficult because they wanted to let me use my medical marijuana, but Icouldn't, because it is illegal to cross state lines with it. Therefore, I did not take that chanceand was in pain for a month until I got home and back on my regimen."


Allow access to higher strength edibles Extend how often you have to renew your card or letevery one buy the same strength products with or without a card





Could not answer question #14. All of the above would be my answer.


Waiting for the cost of medical cannabis to come down. I’m in the fight of my life fightingpancreatic cancer and the need of two other medications costing me almost $ 400.00 per refillfor each medication (my part) I find it difficult to also include my choice of cannabis for painrelief.
I’ve read many reports on opioids and addiction. I strongly feel cannabis is the best painrelief for me and I would like to see the price come down. Thank you!!


"IM concern about the THC.I went to a cannibas store and didnt have to show my card ,also Icant smoke marijuana I have sarcoidosis. Where can I go to get edible where I can use mycard"






The employees at the medical dispensaries need more knowledge since the items areexpensive and it’s it or miss if the purchase will take the pain away.


Would appreciate more convenient locations for medical cannabis.


Only use ointment


The statistic regarding the average price of a gram of marijuana is significantly false.Whomever published that information may want to add a disclaimer which states that price isbefore all state and company taxes as well as which product they are referring to because Ipay almost 9 x’s that price for vape at 100 per gram. I have heard that some surroundingstates such as Maryland offer much lower prices.


I'm happy I don't have to depend on narcotics to relieve my anxiety and pain


I think legalizing cannabis for recreation use is going to change the dispensaries. I have anmedical card shouldn't be paying same amount as someone who has none


The products I have purchased has helped with the pain I have felt from my spinal stenosis.





You’re welcome


I am hopeful that the adult use legalization with bring the cost down for medical use cannabis.


concerned that marijuana would be laced with illegal substances use if pesticides and waste ofmoney. Please preserve those who use it to treat a disabilitating disease


More cbd rich products. It seems like these sell out immediately.


"Hoping it doesn't make the wait times longer, when picking up at the dispensary."


Dont have any money


Delaware needs to have more of a choice of different strains of flower than what is being soldat the dispensaries.Only have access of the same strains sometimes can causes medicalpeople to lose their interest in dispensaries
I've actually stopped my medical marajuana for thissame reason. I also know others who did the same. When there's really not a lot of choicessooner or later the medical marajuana doesn't work in the same way


"Since I got my Medical Marijuana card and can use the products to treat my back pain, it hasbeen a Godsend for me. I am so happy!"


Please make the edibles alot more potent.


"I think the state should put more qualifications on the medical list like anxiety( not cbd rich),ibs, ocd, Pennsylvania is making it really easy to get your medical card and soooo manypeople are signing up for it through the state bc they have more qualifications. Delaware shoulddo the same for the medical patients because it is proven to help with so many things."


I prefer to purchase my medical marijuana from a place that specifically sells for that purpose.I do feel it would be nice to have more places available to purchase it in North Wilmington. Ilike that I have advisors who work with me to find what will help my specific condition and nottake something that could make me worse instead of better. I’m very sensitive to THC incertain strains and avoid those that cause paranoia.


edibles are too low in THC. I'd like to see 25 or 40 MG per dose.


"more testing by ""big pharma"" would help people understand more about marijuana and couldalso help figure out dosage to a better exact science like other medications"


"More reasonable prices all around for medical cannabis would be a good start. Somedispensaries run ""killer"" sales so why can't the price even out?"


"It has been my experience that homegrown cannabis is much, much better than any thedispensary offers. The edible’s and Vape are good, the actual cannabis in bud is pretty and thepre-roll is good. Homegrown, not illegal, is better."


"Prices of adult use in Delaware should be at least 10% lower than medical use, and medicaluse should be lowered by 10% in its prices. As a patient, I have no access to any live resincartridge or disposable products as someone who uses vapes more often. Also lack products"





"such as liquid live resin or live rosin vapes, its time Delaware dispensaries start selling CrescoLabs products. Flower is alright but we are tired of smoking the same distillate everyday.."

Medical Cannabis is expensive. There should be a law passed that health insurancecompanies cover the cost just as we are allotted a certain amount every two weeks. As we areusing it as most likely the prescription drugs didn't work or had damaging effects to other partsof out bodies.


I would more instead of some meds if it cost less. Off SS it is hard now at the cost of food etcto buy it.


Hopefully one day insurance will pay for my medical marijuana


Cannibus has been a miracle for the pain I have from cancer and trigeminal neuralgia


"If I was using flower, I would have many strains from which to choose. I use only MCTtinctures. I have a choice of only Indica or Sativa. I would like more choices."


I think it’s a shame I have to renew my card yearly and have to pay a 100$ fee just for thedoctor to sign the paper when he’s already getting paid from insurance for my visit. Anotherway to line their pockets at patients expense.You don’t pay the doc extra to write you opiates.Why should you have to for cannabis? And if you have a degenerative deteriorating disabilitythat won’t get better you should only have to get 1 card in your lifetime.


"I use tinctures and edibles as actual medicine. It is important to me that the safety and qualityare maintained. I hope that I do not have to pay so much for a medical card, but if keeping oneallows me to continue to receive the same quality of products as I currently do from First StateCompassion then I would probably continue to pay."


"In my opinion, medical cannabis can effectively treat many physical and mental healthconditions, yet as with any drug it should be used with knowledge and discretion, for thepatient's sake and those around them. Now that cannabis has been legalized in DE for adultuse my main concern would be the potential for abuse among those who are young orinexperienced regarding it's potency and psychoactive effects. The law enforcementcommunity will most likely benefit from an increase in dui and other criminal cases from thosewho are reckless enough to ""medicate"" before or while driving. In closing, I'd say thatrecreational cannabis is a bad thing for many people due to the potential for abuse/ accidents,any negative side effects that it may cause, and the fact that smoking and vaping areunhealthy regardless of substance. Once adult use sales begin in Delaware I'll be sure to takeextra caution when venturing out on the roadways and into the stores because some folks actcrazy when they're under the influence and end up doing foolish regrettable things andsometimes don't even remember what they did. Handcuffs, rides in police vehicles, jail cells,and prison food are all great ways to fix that wild misbehavior."


"I should be able to use my own trusted doctor to prescribe medical MJ, but instead the state ofDE forces me to pay outlandish fees to total strangers on the internet who are ""approved"" toprescribe. I will let my card expire unless Delaware changes how it handles medical users."


We need recreational cannabis to stop attacking us a whole. Prices need to be lower causepeople who actually need this stuff can barely afford it. We have should have more variety topick from not the same 6 strains every time





"Cannabis is the only medication I can take to relieve pain in my lower back so that I can sleepat night, that doesn’t destroy the lining in my stomach. Hopefully I can renew my prescriptionevery year"


lower prices


I believe medical.patients should have more access to products. Medical patients shouldcontinue to have exclusive places to purchases their medical marijuana products.


"Insurance companies should be required to accept Medical Marijuana scripts & be used towarddeductibles. No reason insurance companies should be allowed to have such power overpeople, their health, money & Dr wishes."

203
The dispensary


My primary care physician does not know I use cannabis.
"Only my endocrinologist, she"





strongly approves and was the MD that suggested it.

Recreational shouldn’t be equal to medical or no one will see the point in getting the medicalcard.


"I wish my medical marijuana was accepted by my insurance. I buy 4-6 vapes a year for nightpain and a capsule that is half CBD and half THC. With the little use I do, it still is a high costfor those on a limited income."


MORE DISPENSARIES
LESS POLITICS AND MORE PUBLICATION OF THE SCIENTIFICSTUDIES PROVING THC's efficacy!


so much better than using opioids.


I believe there should be an expiration date as all medication’s should have one.


"Outdoor marijuana, is good because less chemicals found in it."


"Require terpenes on packaging and require them to be accurate. Should know what’s beingconsumed other than simply THC and CBD content, which is often close to nil anyway (CBD)."


I’m concerned that legalization of adult use will mean less product for people who need itmedically. Plus people who want medical cards and pay for that should pay way less moneythan public adult use. I wish all insurance companies would cover it as medications.


This has really helped with my RLS and sleep issues.


thank you for making medical marijuana available… very helpful with my symptoms!


I strongly feel that the local medical operators (locally owned) should be able to sell rec. duringthe transition and after the regulations are finalized.


Medical Cannabis needs more specification: i.e. best strain for inflammation; best strain forpain; best strain for anxiety. Now it is described by how it feels almost like it is recreational.


Will Medicare and/or Medicaid one-day cover Medical Cannibis? This way medical Marijuanapatients will not need to do a renewal application.


Medical Marijuana has been very very effective in treating several of my ailments and shouldbe available to all adults. I am happy that it is finally legal since it its an amazingly helpfuldrug.


I just hope that when it becomes legal for adults that the supply goes down..I amkeepingbsticked up because of this..its kind of scarey because I use it daily atleast 3 timesper day!


"It would be nice if it weren't so expensive, because it helps people."


I feel like the amount you can carry is going o high no reason for people to carry an ounce atone time unless just left store. If you have that much your dealing it.


No idea what #19 is referring to.


Medical Marijuana is great for chronic pain and stress. Also Sleep habits.
I prefer marijuanamost before over counter meds or pharmaceutical


"Once the recreational use for cannabis comes into play, I think the price of medical cannabisneeds to be evaluated vs recreational cannabis. I don't think you can charge a much higherprice for one or the other. If price is significantly higher for medical then people will just go therecreational route."


"Question - once adult use is available legally, will a medical card still be necessary?"


Would like to try edibles as the vape smoke bothers my lungs. Former lung CA survivor.


"Bad reaction to big pharma. Initially resistant to provider recommendation for MMJ, butunderstand it's critical role in my daily maintenance to curtail side effects of big pharmamedications."


"I think the price of medical Marijuana needs to be lowered, especially for senior citizens andveterans."






It is important to keep up with news and facts on medical cannabis.


"I need to keep my mmj med card currently in order to keep my healthcare job in Delaware,where I live and work. I also want to be able to grow cannabis in my home. But I live inDelaware, and the powers that be want to prohibit my freedom to grow my medicine of choicein my home. I actually am pretty sure that the medical pot industry has a lot to do with that.It's like a sick joke really. Just another fucking annoying drug dealer to have to deal with so Ican legally keep my job when I get drug tested----OH and the people who make all the drugtests are making a pretty penny too. They're all the same."


It helps I have chronic back pain plus a knee replacement my vape helps me thru the day


I hope that the medical my will continue to be separate. I’m afraid if I have to compete withrecreational users there will be li Ed and they will run out of product. I live in a resort area and Idon’t want to compete with tourists from out of state for my product.


The price of medical marijuana is way too high. The cost is ridiculous and out of reach. Theproduct is dry and not even close to the THC percentage written on the label. If the local medspots do not improve pricing and quality of the product there will be no sense to apply formedical card when it will be fully legal to purchase at a store or on the street. Med patientshave been getting ripped off since this program started here in DE. Sad


"Increase allowable strenghts, decrease price"


"Get insurance to cover medical use, non medical users revenue can help fund that."


My biggest concern in medical and adult dispensaries combining is the number of people itwould attract and any differences in the strength/quality of medical vs. recreational use.


Excited about where the marijuana journey is going


"Allow multiple growers, processors, labs, dispensaries vs the medical program where eachlicenses has to be everything."


"I’m now staying in NJ for a year, but have a card in Delaware."
Can we make the cardsaccepted in surrounding states?
NJ you wait 90 minutes to get in without a card; right in with acard. Thanks!


I have a better quality of life with m.m.and am happy with the way things are


Please allow for higher mg edible options.


I’m afraid if people without card who don’t need product for medical reasons will make it harderfor patients to get the product that works for them . For instance get relief from pain from theeatable products


"I would like to see more variation of strains offered. I would like to grow my own cannabis.Having to paying $250 every year is unfortunate to renew my medical card in Delaware. I alsowould like to be able to obtain a cultivation license in Delaware, if you can point me to anyonewho can help."


Cannabis has been a life changer for my. I lived in pain 24/7 and severe anxiety. I am able toregain part of my life.


"While the medical marijuana has helped my condition, I wish the would consistently stock thesame items. When I find a strain that is particularly helpful, I also find it to be unavailable onfuture purchases."


In need of bigger variety


Medical marijuana patients should be allowed to grow for personal use


Nothing to add


I would love to see the cost go down and have the initial cost be removed .


Medical marijuana has helped me sustain the pain in my feet from neuropathy.


The yearly renewal for patients whose diagnosis will not change is an expensive fee which istotally unfair to the consumer. This should be rectified and stopped. Yearly renewals are no





longer needed with the permanent legislation passed in Delaware. It is time consuming for youand costly for me.

This is an extremely important service that positively affects the lives of many Delawareans.


please lower the prices on products!!! can't always afford what I need.


I am hoping to see the prices go down.


Most times I choose the product that gives me the feeling of well being. Have to try variousproducts first then buy the same one.


Medical Marijuana and CBD oils have help me in multiple was. I was getting debilitatingmigraine headaches on a weekly basis. Now i cant tell you when my last migraine was. Themuscle spasm in my back have gotten much better. It helps me sleep better and longer. I wasable to lower my pain meds since I started using Cannabis


I like edibles rarely smoke. More edibles would be great


I FEEL THIS HAS HELPED THIS SENIOR





I have been to other states and their dispensaries are light years ahead of ours in Delaware.The selection and quality in addition to the staff knowledge and understanding is superior.


Lower prices for medical patients. Or insurance coverages


I wish the legislation was clearer on what and when this was going to go into effect and what itmeans for my card that I paid $250 for.


Wish there was more variety in product selection since I don’t smoke the products


Lower your prices. Street cannabis is cheaper..... Competition is coming ..if you want to keepyour customers





I’m good


"I have no problems with sales of recreational marijuana, but sometimes the dispensaries runout of certain products, and I must make return trip to acquire it. So, I worry about medicinalsupply being shifted, to what will obviously be more sales in recreational side of business.Also being able to only use cash is a big problem,because I must always stop and get cashbefore I go to dispensary. Adding costs and time to trip for meds. So every trip to dispensaryinvolves a search for a place to get cash. How is this even s thing?"


"I understand medical marijuana has to go through more regulation than illegal marijuana, butthe price difference is extreme, especially for older adults living with health concerns andconditions which prevent them from working. Prices in the street are better than dispensaries."


Drop the renewal fee.


"The one thing that concerns me is by the Governor legalizing use of cannabis by all adultsmay result in car accidents, children having access to cannabis. The Governor should havevetoed this bill and kept it only as Medical use for adults with medical conditions."


I think the Delaware Medical Marijuana program is very well run and at least for me is a vitalresource in maintaining my ability to work and provide for my family. I sincerely hope themedical program continues in light of the legalization of recreational use in Delaware.


I would like to see cannabis put in the same cat. as other medications other meds I pay 0 Iunderstand can't pay all just would like to see more of the cost covered otherwise my lifewould have taken a totally different track if legal sooner


Medical cards should have a renewal time of 5 years or more . Medical should stay out oflegalization venues as they didn't support the efforts of those who lobbied legalization. Medicalis supposed too be Non profit but they are making huge profits and Delawares prices are someof the highest in the country even after a well established market . Medical should allow 6vegetative plants and 6 flowering plants for medical use . Just the same as those who prefer





too brew thier own beer or wine even with legalization the price is unaffordable and home growshould be #1 priority




I would like to get more product for my money. I pay for 5 piece's in Delaware when Marylandpackages offer 10 or more for the same price as Delaware


Should not have to pay for the medical card the medical cannabis is very expensive


"All is good, I had a traumatic brain injury and this helps me stay calmed down because I can'tdo things like I used to"


So I think legalizing marijuana is a very bad idea. If a person needs marijuana for a medicalreason then the person should get a card


"Receiving my medical marijuanna card is one of the best things I could have ever did ! I love it, medical marijuanna helps me out a ton , especially with my ptsd and stress and bi-polardisorder as well. Makes me feel more safer about smoking marijuanna as well now becausepeople on the streets are putting fentanyl into marijuanna on the streets now of days , so justhaving my medical marijuanna card makes me feel 10x safer knowing I’m smoking somethinggrown and treated the right way and isn’t going to have any harmful effects on me."


"Insurance should pay a part for people who really need the products. They want people offopioid medications, well this is the answer. CBD oils and creams are helpful for the ones thatdon’t want the THC effects of relief of pain."


I have only been using medical marijuana for several weeks but it has done wonders for mypain & depression.


It’s been very helpful to me. I have such severe back issues and helps me with all the pain. Irefuse to take opioids. I don’t like the way you make me feel.


I think legalizing in DE is a good idea but I hope we look at other states' issues (like CA) anddon't make the same mistakes. I also hope that those who use it for medical reasons won't benegatively impacted by the availability of recreational marijuana in our state.


"It would be nice if DE medical prices were comparable to MI’s ADULT REC WITH TAX. Evenwith my Medicaid discount at any DE dispensary, the prices are ridiculous!"


Not applicable


"This has changed my life for the better in a huge way. It has not cured my pain issues, buthelps greatly."


the t h c products help me sleep and deal with the pain from my two amputations. I thinkmedical patients should pay a lot less for these products than non-medical card holders alsomy condition will never improve but i need a new card each year maybe renew every 5-8 yearslike drivers license





"No to Legalization for Anyone . It does get addicting . I’m a user and if I don’t have it I haveside effects sweats , grumpy"


Lower cost


The price to maintain and renew cards should decrease once adult use is in effect. Why shouldwe pay hundreds of dollars for our cards whwn average Joe can just pay for it with a minimalprice difference





I really had a problem with registering with the doctor and the state. I didn't know how or whatto do. Finally the doctors staff helped me understand what I needed to do. But I didn't get mycard for a month after I seen the doctor.


"The application fee and yearly physician permission, make me reconsider, renewing mymedical marijuana card. I will continue to renew until reputable dispensaries are widelyavailable that do not require a card."






"To insure proper supply of medical grade marijuana, I would certainly expect the medicalcertification to continue for specific strains. But, I know this will be a difficult task, unlessstandards are consistent."


"Medical marijuana use is extremely individual. And I have no moral or religious or philosophicalqualms about using some thing to help with anxiety or pain. I am extremely grateful to havesome thing to help me function as I approach 80. Marijuana enables me to sleep. My anti-depressant prescription dosage has been halved.I drink less. for me, it is an excellent methodof coping with fibromyalgia."





I was taking 8 different medications and I finally got off the last one 3 months ago andMedicinal Marijuana has done that for me


"cannabis products are a powerful drug and it can be abused. I am not happy with legalizationwithout the feds de-schedulizing cannabis. Cannabis users are labeled as law breakers,druggies according to the biden admin. Until they treat cannabis products as other theraputicdrugs that actually helps our medical conditions and not just a recreational drug like alcohol.more people will abuse this drug like all others."

Please keep the prices fair for the seniors whose sole income is from social security. Thanks


I feel like it should be easier for medical use patients to obtain cards and products. Its veryexpensive for us on a fixed income yet necessary for optimal health. I also hope adult usedoesn't effect the availability for medical use. I'm super excited about being able to grow myown plants. Thanks for listening to people and ensuring we have MMJ to care for our healthconditions


Would appreciate more of a selection of medical dispensaries.


I'd just say marijauna isn't harmful. It's about time it's getting legalized. Liquor stores should bereplaced with dispensaries. The state would be much safer.


"Since the adult use bill has passed, I truly think that anyone who's has they're card alreadyshould NOT have to renew it & should still be able to get they're medicine."
"The people whodon't need it medically are going to be able to get it without paying anything extra. Somepatients can barely afford they're medicine let alone a renewal fee year in & year out. Pluswhat's going to happen when 21 & older without a card are able to purchase & it ends upscrewing over people who use it as medicine & the dispensary runs out? Or if the patientscan't get to another dispensary, cuz I don't know if you know this or realize this but a lot ofpatients are unable to drive for one reason or another."


"Medical is a joke. Prices are inflated sooo much. Nothing is accurate. Weights, potencies, etc.first state compassion is the worst followed by Columbia care."





have only found one medical article on marijuana and prescription interaction. would like to seemore research published. I am an RN with a Master's degree. I am a convert. I couldn't believehow quickly it took my pain away. I recommend marijuana for anyone with pain issues but onlyif they purchase it from a licensed dispensary that grows their own marijuana. I have found thatover-the-counter marijuana is useless.


No additional comment


Needs to be more variety overall.


"The only purpose of the use of I have is for my chronic pain for my carpal tunnel, and it hashelped. What I purchase also helps me sleep and relax. I have stopped taken medicationswhich are more expensive more additive. I didn't smoke when I was younger, but now it hasbeen helpful and honestly it has been a life changer."


"No additional comments at this time, thank you."


Thanks


It was very challenging to not have a plan of use when I stared using cannabis products. The





rule was just try anything and use what works best. Very scary.




Very happy that legalization is finally happening. Think that this will reduce the criminal activitybehind the use and sale of this medication.





"Now that it is legal for adult use, my concerns are, that I feel every person should have to gothrough a the registration process and pay the annual fees. The same rule should apply that ifthey own a gun, they cannot apply for a medical license. if a medical license is not obtained,medicinal grade marijuana should not be available for purchase, only lower grade adult usageMarijuana. anyone applying should still only be granted a card if they have a qualified conditionotherwise they should only be allowed to buy public adult usage marijuana."





"I am 60 y/o and have smoked since the age of 13. It helped my anxiety which I suffered fromas the result of bullying. I suffered a frontal lobe injury at 4.5 and know I have impulse controlissues. In the 18 months of having my card, I have lost 80 pds, am no longer obese, BP &sugar under control and found the confidence to leave my dead end job! Of course now I'm justan out of work stoner who can't get a job, but hey: ""I'm happy"" Mr"






I think that pts with a medical card should pay less or it should be covered by insurance justas any other medication is covered by insurance. Other more harmful and dangerous meds arecovered such as oxycodone which has high addiction rates





I hope we can some stronger cannabis


High CBD; low THC should be available to purchase in every dispensary - not just the onesthat “choose” to grow and sell it.
Not having high CBD cannabis to smoke is an injustice torestricted patients! Every dispensary should grow at least two strains!


"I believe med mar to be a effective tool for chronic pain, with medical approval. In conjunctionwith Rx meds it helps control serious pain. Helps me maintain quality of life."


"The attack on me personally, as a citizen of the United States of America, and a Resident ofthe State of Delaware, the continued interference in my ability to live, and have a reasonablyacceptable quality of life, not to mention that the USA and State of Delaware, CDC, DEA, andFDA are all together unilaterally responsible for my current health conditions, not to mentionthe exorbitant PAIN TAX that being forced to use medical marijuana and pay for it out of myown @(#$*&% pocket (which has cost me approximately $50K over just 2 years.) isABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE. And it's HIGH TIME, I SUE TO BE COMPENSATED!"


Free samples


New patient in DE (Had medical card in MD prior to moving). I’m not happy that my particularproduct (CBD tincture Brand) is not sold in DE.


"Please maintain medical marijuana program. Even though the new adult use legislation isthrough, my professional license only protects my use if it is through the medicinal program.There should be a separate inventory for medical and recreational to ensure patients haveaccess to care."


I know it helped me with my anxiety insomnia and my back pain. It helps when my handsshake and my lips


"I have no problems with adult use, as long as there are checks and balances, as long asmedical patients come first and abuse by non patients has consequences. I hope and believethat legally allowing adult usage could stop a large portion of violence. If it isn't hard to get,people like me won't need a security guy to walk us to the Uber because we don't want to berobbed. And we won't be concerned the Uber driver might rob us on way home."


Yes the prices need to be adjusted or something like what’s the benefit of keeping the card


Everything seems to be changing here so fast it's hard to keep up. I do plan to renew my card.





"Regulated cannabis is 10 fold safer than alcohol and a hundred times safer than prescriptionopiates in my opinion. I am glad that Delaware has made it legal, but I sincerely hope that themedical program continues. There is a lot more to marijuana than just"
"getting""high."""

I don’t think medical patients should have to pay more…





Cannabis is a far safer drug than alcohol. It should be regulated in a similar manner as it'smore dangerous counterpart.


Do not make it legal for everyone!!!


"If we were to be able to grandfather in the medical dispensaries and allow them to sell to adultuse patients as well the state could start collecting taxes on it a lot sooner. These companiesalso obviously know what they’re doing so it would be good for them to iron out the front of theissues to smooth the path for following dispensaries. These are the companies that firstbrought the product to the state, who better to start this path off for us?"


"In my opinion, the medical marijuana program has benefited many in our state, especiallyseniors. I am hoping that legalization will bring more complete studies of marijuana whilegenerating additional tax revenues. My only reservations concerning legalization is the toll ittakes on abusers and the money it takes from the families who can least afford it, much likealcohol took from my family when I was a child"


Would like for all dispensaries to provide terpine profiles for flower.


Medical cards should be auto renewed.


Good app for information is LEAFLY


Worried that legal adult use will drive up the price and make product more scarce.Dispensaries already have a tough time of keeping up with inventory.


None


Please lower the price. We the people are poor.





"There needs to be some kind of ""policing"" over the recreational marijiuana to insure it is pureand has no harmful substance laced in it."


Question 9 was ambiguous it doesn’t specify when we first got our first medical card vs whenwe got a DE medical card.


Look it needs to be legal. It's safer than drinking!!


My Dr. charges $200 for the paperwork. I am on a fixed income and it is hard for me to pay this








Personally the average for a g at the dispo is 14. All the medical dispensaries that lobbiedagainst legalization should REMAIN MEDICAL ONLY. Remove the 50mg limit on edible mgand allow me to medicate how I need for my condition. Bonus if the medical dispo have to giftdisability patients an eighth per $70-100 spent after all they are supposed to be not for profitright and it isn't covered by insurance like opiods and other medicines are. Paying out ofpocket on disability is a struggle to choose between getting everything I need and paying bills.


I support all decisions and advice


I think medical marijuana should be more affordable and more potent. Recreational cannabisshould remain the same price as medical cannabis there should be no discrimination againstrecreational cannabis and medical cannabis.


Now that it’s legal cards should just automatically renew


I had fibromyalgia pain which made my sleep very bad and restless. Medical marijuana hasallowed me to have the best nights of sleep in decades.






More cbd flower


Growing should be legal similar to brewing beer.


Medical Marijuana saves my life everyday!


"I would gladly be a part of a group that retained their medical card if it came along with lessinterference in access to marijuana like delivery, discounts, think tank feedback for legislators,etc. but at this point, it seems like an expensive burden to requalify (especially since my PCPwon’t)."





These products are far too costly especially compared to our neighboring States. We alsoneed more arthritis friendly containers.


It should make any past charges be automatically removed from our permanent record andhelp us get jobs in the industry of pot so we can be active in future changes and in growingbecause most of us have be doing it all way before these some what laminate growers and sowe can get involved in more regulation and security and education on pot and mushrooms


"I’ll retain my card, I think legalizing is smart to a degree. Everything has its pros and cons butI think this is a positive shift for all."


I can't wait for when I bo longer have to pay $150+ each year to maintain my medical use card.That is a lot of money for a retiree. I hope the 55+ measure is passed.


"I am concerned that recreational use will make medical marijuana more expensive, and l amconcerned that the quality will not be as good. I hope that medical card holders will continue tohave access to secure facilities to buy their products separate from recreational use facilities.It is important for medical users to be able to get a quality product, and also have it availableto them ahead of recreational users."


Limiting the amount of cannabis makes it difficult to maintain medical care effectiveness





Products are not potent enough. Too expensive. And very unavailable


"There sure is a lot of bad hype about marijuana. As a health care professional for over 40years, I have never dealt with a mean, angry or hostile pot smoker! But I saw nasty,sometimes dangerous drinkers!!"


I would consider maintaining my medical card if the fee to have it was not as expensive. I alsobelieve adults should have the option to grow their own cannabis legally.


No thanks


"I only use the tinctures for my fibro and it gave me a life back. I also use the cooking hash tosleep. Glad to not be using prescriptions, but being retired it is a bit pricy."


"Thanks to all the supporters that made this happen, it’s a much needed choice for selftreatment."


I am for legal MJ. But I would want to keep my medical card if I could purchase a qualityproduct for my medical conditions.


We need lower prices like out west


Strong feelings that the Medical Card should be FREE!! Cost of prerolled and loose ispresently too high.
"Medical users should be able to grow for personal use, to offset theexpense of using a dispensary. Who has all of this money to spend when they are sick??"


I would like the mm despencery to stay but maybe more competitive with pricing.Just sometype of discount


I have worked at fsc and that place is horrible. They lack on all qualities. And the Farm onlysurvives cause of the godfather Chuck... bill really knows nothing of growing weed. And myoutlook on them jobs is joke... I'm street kid and the street will take care of the dispsarysnonsense... big things are coming and hope neither make it out.


The legalization of marijuana means nothing if the legislation doesn’t allow medical marijuana





patients the ability to legally grow our own medicine.

Medical users really need to get insurance companies on board paying for product or partialpay of it.. and we should be charged less then adult recreation users


"I hope they can keep up with the demand, so medical patients never have to do without."


"As far as medical dispensaries selling to anyone, I would be concerned that the products I useand need may sell out frequently and not be there when I need them."


This survey is very general. I hope that helps.


None


The difference in the quality of life since I have been using medical marijuana is so muchbetter.


Leafly.


Cost is a major factor - I truly believe when legal marijuana use becomes availible for all youwill lose many customers if you don’t lower prices.


What kind of question is question number 12. Everybody uses what you call illegal marijuanabecause it’s now selling for $100 an ounce and your lowest dispensary cost is about 210 to240. No one can answer that question. Not even in a survey. thanks for your time.

"Need more dispensaries in Sussex county. It’s a spread out area and would rather avoid Rt 1to get to Columbia cares. The rt 9 dispensary is excessively secure. Require metal wand,locker for purse and not nice about it. Went once and won’t be back. Need a dispensarybetween Rehoboth and millsboro."


Medical card holders should have better access and pricing than adult use since it is used asa medication


"I am a little concerned that having adults use of cannabis, May hinder medical users forgetting their product"


Price needs to be much lower for medical. Surrounding states prices are much cheaper thanDE


"It would be helpful if the state of DE would consent to allow medical use patients the option(s)to purchase any sort of THC medicated edibles in doses HIGHER than only 10mg/each.Currently all that is available is 5 packs of 10mg each edibles, which is not enough of a doseto have the desired effect for many patients ive talked with about this as well as for myself."


No further comments.


Thanks


Would like to make the card multi-year instead of tey renewal. I like that idea!





I am overall pleased with the medical program and would like to continue with it.


Ensure availability for those with medical needs


We need home grow. At a minimum for medical use patients. The price gouging andunaffordable cannabis keeps medical use patients returning to the black market.


"I really wish all the dispensaries would double check the pre-packaged flower and ensure thatthey all are consistent in weight and do actually weigh what they’re supposed to and NOTanything below that! I’m so sick and tired of being short .5 in one or .3 in another and .4 insomething else, right there is equivalent to over a gram of flower I’m out that I paid for! Now"





"who profits from that? Certainly NOT me! So please make sure EVERYTHING that’s sent outis either right on point or at least a little bit over, but NEVER leave us short as that’s justwrong!!"

Just hope insurance would some day cover it.


Fresh and the farm grow terrible flower. Need more strains and variety.


"I am still new at using the product, I rely on help from the staff at Columbia Care to steer me inthe right direction as to what will help me for my chronic pain."


Receive information from dispensary salespeople to determine the appropriate product.


The costs are too high. Insurance should cover it medical.


"The pot that’s grown in Delaware is horrible it makes you feel like your on cloud nine, I like thepens!"


Insurance company declined my gabapentin for GN. I was only on 700 mg/day. Medicalmarijuana allowed me to function- otherwise the pain would have been unbearable. I was alsoheaded toward deep depression without the gabapentin because the pain was horrible.


"I use high CBD (45%) vape which is hard to get. I think medical dispensaries should stayseparate from recreational, I don’t want my supply to be depleted."


"As a senior on a very fixed income, I just want access to affordable high THC edible medicalmarijuana."


People with medical card should not be paying more. The cost should go to those who do nothave medical card.


"I'm happy to be a mmj patient and I have no problem with the new laws coming into effectsoon, some already are in effect. I hope that in the future Delaware mmj program looks intohow other states run their program, such as separate growers, manufacturing and sales. I thinkit is too much responsibility for a dispensary to have to do all 3."


"It doesn’t matter, if the prices continue to jump upwards of 10% twice a year, not sure howanyone on disability will be able to afford in the next couple years."


The program helps!! What would be better is if all the dispensaries sold the same product! Likefrom the different stores. I sometimes have to go to different places to get the selection ofstuff I need.


"I live with chronic pain & nothing else has helped me. Using care with my products & using athome. I would really like it, if it was approved to take with you when you travel as sometimesthat is when I need it the most. Also, I would appreciate not selling recreational at the medicaldispensary. I would hate for them to run out when I use it for pain & not recreation. I also wouldhate long lines when I’m making a purchase. Thank you"


"Cream, edibles & drink additives are convenient to add to the pain relief i get from cannabisproducts."


hoping for a smooth transition into the new system.

Since I got my card .I use edibles more . I smoke when I can't fall asleep because of pain.

"It cost’s too much already then the street at $225 an ounce special that’s the problem. Itshould cost $150 for a 25% ounce of MM that would decrease illegal street sales with no salestax of course for card holders . That’s how you get people to get cards and stop buying off thestreet. No sales tax , lower price , better safe quality higher THC/CBD % ."
