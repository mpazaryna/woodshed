Aug 18,"Yeah, Delta 8 didn’t do anything positive for me either. Another hyped up product that turned out to be a let down for me."
Aug 18,"I have chronic pain and this is the only thing that has truly helped. I've tried other CBD products. This does contain delta 8 THC, but it's very mild. I take 1/2 dropper 3-4 times a day. The site is constantly sending out 20-30% off coupon codes"

Aug 28,That delta 8 shit gets me fucked up
Aug 28,"If it says something like ""Grape Ape"" that usually is referring to the strain that it's derived from, not the flavor. Common misconception. Delta 8 does have a lot of benefits, particularly for folks with cancer that it was intended for. What I hate is it gets abused like so..."
Aug 28,"I normally use Delta 8 or Dispensary grade products, but I’d be down to try out some other CBD products! My knowledge of CBD is limited at the moment"

Aug 29,Tldr: no oversight in how they extract/synthesize delta-8. Chemist fear people are not properly prepping these products for safe consumption. Isomers of THC are not the concern.
Aug 30,hit a delta 8 pen at the vape shop and currently unable to walk in a straight line
Aug 30,is delta 8 legal? yes. does buying it feel illegal? also yes.

Aug 31,"So I tried some Delta 8 I got from a friend. I took about 3/4th of a gummy. It was good stuff, and it’s legal in GA and a lot of other states. So look up info on your state, if weed isn’t legal yet."
