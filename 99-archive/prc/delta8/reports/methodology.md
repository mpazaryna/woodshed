# Delta 8 Analysis: Methodology and Significance

## 1. Methodology Overview

The analysis of Delta 8 THC-related tweets involves several key steps:

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
2. Keyword Extraction and Analysis
3. Sentiment Analysis
4. Theme Generation
5. Comparative Analysis (Pre vs Post periods)
6. Visualization (Word Clouds)

### 1.1 Data Loading and Preprocessing

- Raw data is loaded from CSV files containing tweets.
- Text preprocessing involves:
  - Removing special characters and converting to lowercase
  - Tokenization (breaking text into individual words)
  - Removing stop words (common words like "the", "a", "an" that don't carry significant meaning)
  - Part-of-speech tagging to focus on nouns, verbs, and adjectives

### 1.2 Keyword Extraction and Analysis

- Preprocessed texts are used to extract the most common words (keywords).
- Frequency analysis is performed to identify the most prevalent topics in the discussions.
- Comparison between pre and post periods to identify shifts in discourse.

### 1.3 Sentiment Analysis

- Each tweet is analyzed for sentiment using NLTK's VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analyzer.
- Four sentiment scores are calculated for each tweet:
  - Positive: Measure of positive sentiment
  - Negative: Measure of negative sentiment
  - Neutral: Measure of neutral sentiment
  - Compound: Normalized sum of all the lexicon ratings, ranging from -1 (most negative) to 1 (most positive)

### 1.4 Theme Generation

- Predefined themes are used to categorize keywords.
- This helps in understanding the main topics of discussion around Delta 8.

### 1.5 Comparative Analysis

- Comparison of keywords, themes, and sentiment between pre and post periods.
- This helps in identifying how the discourse around Delta 8 has evolved over time.

### 1.6 Visualization

- Word clouds are generated to visually represent the most frequent keywords.
- This provides an intuitive understanding of the dominant topics in each period.
