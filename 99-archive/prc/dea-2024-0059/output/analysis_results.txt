The medicinal benefits have been reported for decades now and recreational use has proven to be more safe than alcohol. If this was put to an actual vote, America would overwhelmingly vote for full legalization.

The fact it was placed under schedule 1 for so long and now moving it to Schedule 3 makes a mockery the entire classification system. Why place marijuana in the same category as ketamine? Is it as habit forming or as dangerous as ketamine? No , no it is not. Secondly we allow alcohol and tobacco both more harmful both physically and socially, this will do far less damage to society than either of those. Finally it is a waste of resources and time for law enforcement to continue to fight against marijuana. We have a crisis with opioids and meth which do serious social and physical harm to this country. The money spent on marijuana enforcement could be better utilized to fighting against those other substances. Decriminalize and allow recreational, allow ATF to take over enforcement and manage just as they do for alcohol and tobacco.

2  DEA-2024-0059-27371   lyc-5a9y-trso  2024-07-07T04:00Z  Docket No. DEA-1362\n\nI am in favor of moving Cannabis to schedule III. Keeping Cannabis in schedule 1 is harming innocent people, and it is also in fact unscientific. There is an abundance of scientific findings that tell us what we already know through common sense - cannabis is not highly addictive, is far less harmful than heroin or cocaine, and has a plethora of known medical uses. Because of its high safety profile, the fact that it has never been a cause of overdose death, and that in fact we know and have known for thousands of years that is safe and often beneficial for adults to use, I argue that cannabis should be taken off the controlled substances list for the long term, and put on the G.R.A.S. The Generally Recognized As Safe list is more consistent with what science says about the safety of cannabis and also with historical use patterns.\n\nNo one should be punishing you in any way for consuming cannabis - it should be a completely unpunished behavior. Its procurement and use should be in the realm of doctors and health coaches, not in the realm of criminality.\n\nAllowing for the unbridled flow of cannabis in all its forms, in a high scale way, would be the most intelligent and helpful to our country’s economy.\n\nIt’s terrible that to this day, law enforcement in many states in fact continue to harm people’s lives by punishing them for consuming cannabis. This must change, as it is beyond unethical given what we know about cannabis today, and is an abysmal use of tax dollars. Not to mention the punishments are more harmful to one’s life than the act of smoking the bud was.\n\nCannabis stands out for its uses as bud people smoke and make into edibles, to plant based concrete referred to as Hempcrete, and even for biodiesel that can be used in cars. It’s important that we not only cease harming and punishing cannabis consumers, but that we try to in fact facilitate its thriving.\n\nCannabis production, particularly outdoor grows, is a renewable process. For the purpose of biodiesel, we examine the process and find that using the sun’s energy as the input source of energy for its biomass, via the method of photosynthesis (SunProducingBiomass), cannabis plants and seeds are grown, and then to oil extraction of the seeds, and then the seed oil goes through transesterification to plant biodiesel - we are able to bring about powering cars in a renewable process. A plant-based process, which happens to be Carbon Dioxide Neutral.\n\nI say this because I think there is a path here - if Cannabis seed biodiesel, along with better solar power batteries for solar panel setups are thought of as a suite and together, and both strategies implemented on a large scale, then I believe we could make a dent in the issue of climate change.\n\nPlease do reschedule Cannabis to schedule III, as it is a significant step.\n\nPlease do not hastily find a reason to dismiss the entirety of what I say, or act out of fear.

If anything alcohol should be a schedule 1 controlled substance. The amount of people alcohol has killed compared to the 0 on record marijuana has killed is insane to me. I think the whole list of schedule drugs needs to be relooked at. Plant medicines should not be a schedule 1. It’s 2024 this is actually ridiculous.
