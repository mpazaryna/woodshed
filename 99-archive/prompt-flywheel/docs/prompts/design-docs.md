# Design Docs

I need help creating a design document for a code analysis project. Please help me by answering these questions:

1. What's the core problem your code needs to solve?
2. Share any relevant code snippets or describe the functionality you're planning to implement.
3. Are there any specific technical constraints or requirements?
4. Who are the key stakeholders who will review or use this code?
5. What's your timeline for implementation?

After answering these initial questions, we can explore:

- Technical architecture options
- Implementation approaches
- Performance considerations
- Testing strategies
- Deployment plans

I'll help structure your responses into a comprehensive design document following each answer.
