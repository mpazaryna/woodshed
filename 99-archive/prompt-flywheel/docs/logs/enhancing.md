# Prompt Enhancement System Documentation

## Overview

The Prompt Enhancement System implements an iterative content improvement workflow through AI-assisted refinement. At its core, the system combines evaluation and enhancement components to systematically improve content quality using large language models.

## System Architecture

The system's foundation rests on three primary components working in concert. The Content Evaluator serves as the analytical engine, processing content against domain-specific criteria and generating detailed quality assessments. The LLM Improver orchestrates the enhancement process, managing iteration loops and strategy selection while interfacing with language models through the service layer. This service abstraction provides a clean interface to different LLM implementations, currently supporting Claude through a factory pattern.

Enhancement strategies in the system follow a dynamic selection process. The comprehensive strategy triggers for content scoring below 50%, initiating complete rewrites to address fundamental issues. For content above this threshold, the targeted strategy activates, focusing improvements on specific underperforming sections while preserving high-quality content.

## Implementation Details

The evaluation process begins with content parsing and criteria extraction, followed by systematic section analysis. The system calculates scores and generates actionable recommendations, producing detailed reports in both JSON and Markdown formats. This evaluation feeds into the improvement workflow, where content undergoes iterative enhancement until reaching target quality thresholds.

The technical implementation leverages TypeScript and Deno, emphasizing strong typing and modular design. Each component maintains clear boundaries and responsibilities, allowing for independent testing and future extensibility. Configuration options span domain-specific requirements, target metrics, and service settings, providing flexibility for different use cases.

## Workflow Specification

```gherkin
Feature: Content Enhancement
  As a content creator
  I want to improve my content quality
  So that it meets specified requirements

  Scenario: Initial Content Evaluation
    Given a markdown file in the output directory
    When the evaluation system analyzes the content
    Then it generates a detailed quality report
    And calculates section-specific scores
    And provides improvement recommendations

  Scenario: Content Enhancement Loop
    Given an evaluated content piece
    When the score is below target threshold
    Then the system selects an enhancement strategy
    And generates improved content using LLM
    And saves the new version
    And re-evaluates the content
    And continues until reaching target score or max iterations

  Scenario: Strategy Selection
    Given content evaluation results
    When the score is below 50%
    Then apply comprehensive improvement strategy
    When the score is above 50%
    Then apply targeted improvement strategy
    And preserve high-scoring sections

  Scenario: Report Generation
    Given completed enhancement iteration
    When improvements are verified
    Then generate JSON evaluation report
    And create markdown summary
    And include section-specific scores
    And list implemented improvements
