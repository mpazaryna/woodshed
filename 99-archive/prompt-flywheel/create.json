  "concept": "After a series of unexplained sightings and occurrences in the night sky, Extra Terrestrials officially arrive in force around Earth. A warrior-kind, operating by a strict code: no war, no invasion, as they have no intent to damage an ecosystem they wish to make their own. Instead they select a planet's greatest warriors/heroes to participate in a gauntlet - a test of worthiness to preserve/protect their world from takeover. Should anyone one of our warriors survive, humanity is spared, and they move on. Unfortunately for Earth, these aliens have never once lost before... To make matters even worse, their data collection is a mess; their long-range scanners picked up our broadcast signals from decades ago, while their short-range scans captured recent transmissions but their system is unable to tell between the two due to the nature of broadcasting reruns. Unable to determine which era's warriors are truly Earth's mightiest, they summon our champions: aging action stars from the 80s and 90s now in their 60s and 70s, alongside today's younger generation of 'heroes'.  The result is an unlikely team of Hollywood's toughest - spanning from weathered veterans who, if still alive, can barely touch their toes to entertainment's most current assembly of action stars and social media influencers - most of whom have never thrown a real punch, much less faced any sort of real battle or true violence in their lives. There should be 9 characters.",
