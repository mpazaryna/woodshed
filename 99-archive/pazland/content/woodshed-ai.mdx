# A Year in the Woodshed: A Development Practice in the Age of AI

Traditionally, a woodshed was more than just a storage space - it was a dedicated space for practice and growth. Like yoga, 
which transforms from physical movement to a mindful way of being, development can transcend mere coding to become a 
thoughtful practice. For the past twelve months, I've maintained my own practice in a "woodshed," exploring 
how to write software in an AI-transformed landscape.

## Establishing the Practice

Creating a well-organized space is essential for any meaningful practice. I created a monorepo not just as a collection 
of experiments, but as a structured environment for daily exploration. Each session building upon the last, each 
challenge offering new insights into how AI is reshaping our approach to code.

## Elements of Practice

### Foundation Work

The foundation of any practice starts with understanding the basics:
- Understanding how to structure projects that integrate with AI services
- Developing patterns for testing code that interacts with probabilistic systems
- Finding balance between traditional development and AI-assisted approaches

### Daily Practice

My experiments became daily exercises in understanding:
- Using Streamlit to prototype and test AI integrations
- Building SQL interfaces to bridge traditional and AI-enhanced development
- Exploring how state management and testing evolve with AI in the stack

### Creating Space

Just as important as the practice itself was creating the right environment:
- Establishing Git workflows that support AI-assisted development while maintaining code quality
- Developing testing approaches that work with both traditional code and AI components
- Maintaining environments that balance familiar tools with new AI frameworks

## Technical Foundation

The practice is supported by a balanced technical stack:
- Python as the foundational language
- Traditional development tools, adapted for new challenges
- Integration patterns for AI services
- Modern UI tools for rapid prototyping
- Experimental spaces for learning and testing

## Key Learnings

### 1. Structure Creates Freedom

The monorepo's organization created space for growth and experimentation while maintaining stability. This structure provided a 
framework for consistent progress without constraining creativity.

### 2. Adaptation is Essential

Traditional development patterns needed mindful adaptation to work with new technologies. What worked before didn't always 
translate directly to AI-enhanced development.

### 3. Environment Matters

A practice needs the right space and tools. Managing the development environment proved crucial for maintaining 
consistency and growth, especially when working with both traditional and AI-powered tools.

## Moving Forward

This year in the woodshed has established a foundation for growth in the AI era. Like any meaningful practice, it's not 
about reaching a final destination but about continuing to learn and adapt. Each day brings new opportunities 
to deepen understanding and refine techniques.

The woodshed-ai project remains active and growing. It's become a space for regular practice, 
experimentation, and learning. Feel free to explore the project and perhaps begin your own practice in 
AI-era development. The most valuable lesson has been that regular, mindful practice creates 
the space for genuine growth and understanding.
