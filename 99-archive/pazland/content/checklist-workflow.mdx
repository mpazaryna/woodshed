Modern software development follows a structured approach across three main stages: Pre-Development, Development, and
Production, with Continuous Improvement as an ongoing process.

The Pre-Development stage focuses on problem definition, domain exploration, project planning, and technology 
stack selection. This phase establishes the project's foundation by identifying stakeholders, analyzing 
requirements, and choosing appropriate technologies for both frontend and backend development.

The Development stage encompasses initial setup and bootstrap, core functional implementation, frontend 
and backend development, review and refinement, and deployment for early access. Each component is 
carefully constructed and tested before moving to production.

The Production stage centers on maintenance and monitoring, while Continuous Improvement drives 
ongoing feedback loops, iterative development, knowledge management, and regular technology stack 
reviews to keep the project current and effective.

A comprehensive checklist covering all these stages and their detailed tasks is maintained 
and regularly updated at [this gist](https://gist.github.com/mpazaryna/7fdf77ff89e28fdf550cd2894a8aae82), providing 
developers with a structured guide through the entire development lifecycle.
