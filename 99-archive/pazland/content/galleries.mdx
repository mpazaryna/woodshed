I'm on the Asbury Park Beach and Boardwalk often.  

I've taken many photos and I've used Google Photos, Apple Photos, SmugMug and Flickr. In each of those 
services, I've thought this is the best place to store photos.  I've started to move away
from the online services and have been building an archive locally on my machine.

I'm interested by the idea of [Publish on Your Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) and
the above photo is from the local archives, published to Flickr and displayed here.
