I’m often asked about the difference between the types of production incentives offered. I’ll caveat that I’m no accountant, but I _can_ offer a basic breakdown of the four main types of production incentives you’ll encounter and what they mean for your production.

# REBATE

These are the holy grail of production incentives (note: some places have grants, which are similar). It’s straight-up cash that the jurisdiction will pay to a production entity (generally a percentage of qualifying spend in the jurisdiction). Because this type of incentive is not contingent on filing a tax return, they generally pay out quickly—sometimes in less than three months. Malta, Mongolia, Morocco, Mississippi, and Minnesota all offer production rebates. And lest you think it’s just an “M” thing, so does Colorado—and various types of unscripted content qualify in all of them, too.

# REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT

These are also pretty juicy. Basically, the production entity files a return in the state, and any amount of credit above and beyond their tax liability will come back in the form of a cash refund. If the production entity has no tax liability, upon filing, they’ll receive a rebate in the full amount. Hawaii, Connecticut, and New Mexico are just a few US states that offer refundable tax credits, and as above, various types of unscripted content qualify. Keep in mind, however, that depending on the timeline for filing a return, you may not see your cash for over a year.

# TRANSFERABLE TAX CREDIT

Transferable tax credits require a little more legwork. The full value of the credit can be applied against the production entity’s tax liability in the jurisdiction OR – if they have no tax liability - the credit can be sold on the open market, usually at a discount.

There’s often a decent market for these credits (for the buyer, it’s like buying a discount on your tax bill), and broker services to handle the transactions. If you simply sell the credit, you’ll likely get your cash faster than you would with a refundable tax credit, since you don’t have to wait to file a return.

**One point of caution:** if you **know** you’ll be selling/transfering a tax credit, be sure to factor the discount rate into your accounting, or you might be surprised when that million-dollar incentive your were counting on turns out to yield only $900K. The Dominican Republic and US state of Georgia offer transferable tax credits, and unscripted qualifies.

# NON TRANSFERABLE, NON REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT

These are the most restrictive, as the production entity can only apply the credit against their own tax liability. Often, if the amount of the credit exceeds the company’s tax burden, they can carry the credit forward and apply it to their tax bill for a given number of years. The downside is that the production entity might not recoup the full value of the credit for several years. This type of credit is less common, however.

Note that some jurisdictions offer additional non-traditional incentives, like exemptions on hotel, sales & use taxes or waivers on permit fees. It’s always worth asking what might be available.

**That wasn’t so bad, right?** As always, there are often plenty of caveats when it comes to production incentives, including minimum spend requirements, hiring requirements, application deadlines and more. Some states require out-of-state production companies to register and for out-of-state crew to pay local payroll taxes in order to receive their incentive. Audits are generally required, and they’re \*not\* free. A (real) production accountant can help you determine if these additional costs negate the value of an incentive for your production.
