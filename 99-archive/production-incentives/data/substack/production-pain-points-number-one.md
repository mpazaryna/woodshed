# Incentives Research

For those new to the process, there are some basic FREE TOOLS that help take the pain out of researching incentives. Of course, rules, requirements, and funding around incentives are constantly changing, so always verify!

## The Olsberg Global Incentives Index

Olsberg’s global production incentives bible is updated twice a year. The May 2024 edition covers over 100 jurisdictions, with details on the incentives offered, requirements, budget/annual caps, deadlines, links for each program, and more.

While it’s one of the most reliable and comprehensive sources, unscripted producers may be frustrated by the lack of specifics about what types of unscripted content qualify in each jurisdiction (given that some extend incentives to, say, documentaries but not reality shows). Obviously, since it’s released twice a year, it won’t have the most up-to-date changes to programs. Regardless, the Olsberg Index offers a wealth of information, available for FREE—you just have to register to download it

## Entertainment Partners (EP)

We love Entertainment Partners’ global for the level of detail it offers unscripted producers. Where the Olsberg Index falls short, EP breaks the unscripted category down to indicate if an incentive applies to a variety of individual categories, including reality, game shows, animation, talk shows, post only, commercials, and video games.

The easy-to-read format details at a glance if/how the incentive applies to resident v. non-resident labor, if there are any uplifts, if a credit and audit are required, and if loan outs have to register and pay local taxes. Like Olsberg, the EP online search tool also lists contacts and websites for each program. We’ve occasionally encountered outdated information, but it’s a great starting point, especially for unscripted content.

## Cast & Crew: Incentives Map

Wondering if the incentive is more competitive in Georgia or Illinois? Want to compare the incentive in Alabama v. Connecticut v. Arizona? The Cast & Crew tool enables users to quickly compare incentives in up to six jurisdictions in the US and Canada. The tool doesn’t, however, indicate which categories of content qualify in each jurisdiction.

## Cast & Crew: Tip Guide

For that information related to content in juristidictions outside North America — turn to its comprehensive Tip Guide. We love the combination of at-a-glance details and full-page breakdowns for each jurisdiction, and the introductory section is great for beginners.
