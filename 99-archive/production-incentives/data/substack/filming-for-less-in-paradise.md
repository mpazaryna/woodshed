A number of spectacular locations around the world offer production incentives, making shooting in paradise more affordable than you might think.

**They include:**

**THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC**

The Dominican Republic has been attracting productions for decades, including _Pirates of the Caribbean,_ _Jurassic Park_ and the more recent _The Lost City_ and _Shotgun Wedding_.

On the television front, the country has hosted countless international versions of _Survivor,_ the _Bachelor/Bachelorette_ franchise, and _Paradise Hotel_.

“The DR” offers a wide range of locations, from tropical jungles and beautiful beaches to deserts and rich historical architecture.

Given its robust production scene, you’ll also find experienced crew, equipment, [stellar private resorts](https://www.casadecampo.com.do/about-us/photo-and-film-shoots/) accustomed to hosting productions, and studio space, including [Pinewood Studios’ water filming facilities](https://pinewoodgroup.com/studios/pinewood-dominican-republic-studios).

On to the incentive: the Dominican Republic offers a 25% transferable tax credit on eligible expenses with a $500K minimum spend, and unscripted qualifies (including reality). There’s no per-project cap, and resident and non-resident labor qualifies (subject to withholding and a 25% local labor requirement).

To apply, you must either work through a local service provider that’s registered with the Film Commission or register your production entity locally.

**PANAMA**

Panama boasts beautiful beaches, lush tropical rainforests, and over **1,000 islands** for your filming pleasure. Unscripted and reality content qualifies for its incentive, making it ideal for dating and survival/competition formats. Indeed, it’s hosted various versions of _The Bachelor_, _Survivor_, and _Amazing Race._

It’s also considered outside the hurricane belt, and its mainland location means prices are generally lower here than on Caribbean islands. That said, productions located further from the capital may understandably encounter more logistical challenges.

Panama’s rebate on qualifying spend recently jumped from 15% to a generous 25%, including resident labor, against a $500K minimum spend.

**COLOMBIA**

[Colombia](https://locationcolombia.com/en/advantages/colombia/) has lots to offer, including diverse locations that include major cities, historic architecture, dense jungles, and sandy beaches. Add a strong local talent pool, easy access from the US, _and_ an incentive and it’s no wonder Colombia has become an industry hotspot, drawing productions like _Freelance, Sound of Freedom, Lost City of Z,_ and the series _Narcos_.

The country offers a choice between a 20-40% rebate (depending on nature of the expense) OR a 35% transferable tax credit when working through a local service provider, while minimum qualifying spend hovers around $475K.

Unscripted and reality qualify here as well, and it’s lured multiple versions of the popular reality series _Naked & Afraid_.

**TRINIDAD & TOBAGO**

Nestled in the southern Caribbean, the twin islands of [Trinidad and Tobago](https://filmtt.co.tt/) offer a contrasting variety of locations.

Home to the capital city of Port of Spain, Trinidad offers more urban flair, with historic architecture, music festivals, and its annual Carnival. Tobago, in contrast, is the go-to spot for secluded beaches, tropical jungles and private beachfront villas.

While it might not have as robust a production infrastructure as other locations mentioned, it’s one of the most affordable locations in the Caribbean, with a 12.5 - 35% sliding scale rebate starting at just $100K in local spend – plus a 20% bonus rebate on local labor.

Both scripted and unscripted qualify (including reality). Plus, these islands are considered outside the Caribbean hurricane belt.

The islands were the setting of classics like _Dr. No_ (1962) and _Swiss Family Robinson_ (1960), as well as recent episodes of _Naked & Afraid_, _Amazing Race_ and _Love and Hip Hop_. While rules state that 50% of a production must take place on the islands, they may be flexible for the right projects.

**HAWAII**

In 2023 [Hawaii](https://filmoffice.hawaii.gov/) bumped its refundable tax credit up to 22% (for Oahu) and 27% (for the Big Island, Kauai, Lanai, Maui, Molokai), while lowering its required minimum spend to a mere $100K, making it more accessible to unscripted productions (they qualify!).

Resident and non-resident labor qualify, though productions are expected to make “reasonable efforts” to hire local crew and maximize in-state production spend.

Countless productions have taken advantage of Hawaii’s steller locations, services and scenery, including _White Lotus_, _Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Jurassic Park, Hunger Games: Catching Fire, Lost, Godzilla…_plus reality series like _The Bachelor, Top Model, Top Chef, Temptation Island,_ and more.

**And that’s not all!**

A number of other tropical jurisdications have recently rolled out or modified their incentives offering, including the [Philippines,](https://www.filmphilippines.com/) Thailand, [Malaysia](http://filminmalaysia.com/) and [Fiji](https://film-fiji.com/), expanding your options for filming in paradise.

**And we’re keeping an eye on:**

**Barbados:** The Caribbean island nation recently lured an episode of _Succession_ to its shores by offering an incentive, but we’re told that final details on its formal incentive program are still winding their way through the legislature.

**Ghana:** The West African nation recently announced a [20% film production tax rebate](https://deadline.com/2024/02/ghana-tax-incentive-20-film-productions-1235841133/), with further details forthcoming. We’re watching!

# Where Would You Most like to Film?

**Of course, filming in paradise can have its drawbacks.** Goods and services on islands can be more expensive than on the mainland. In the Caribbean, you have to watch out for hurricane season (June-November), while cyclones are a factor in the Pacific. Tourist season can call out the crowds and higher prices.

**As always**, each program carries its own rules and qualifications that are subject to change, so be sure to double-check the details.
