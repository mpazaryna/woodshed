Producers diving into incentives for the first time remind me of young kids at the beach.

Some run enthusiastically toward the water. Others tiptoe in tentatively.

Either way, watch when that first terrifying wave comes crashing in.

More often than not, the kiddos turn tail and race back to the safety of the shore.

**The same goes for producers and incentives.**

At first they’re intrigued…but as the inevitable wave of rules and requirements descends, many get scared off.

There are lots of details to consider with incentives, and every program is different.

It can all get pretty overwhelming.

But ten simple questions can help you determine if an incentive is right for your project from the outset—**and keep you from wasting valuable time if it isn’t.**

# Does My Content Qualify?

This one seems obvious, but it’s tricker than you might think.

First, there’s content type. Scripted often qualifies (okay, not adult films).

But with unscripted, the rules get granular. Documentaries might qualify, but not reality TV. And even if it appears that unscripted doesn’t qualify, dramatic or historical recreations might, even if they’re part of an unscripted series. Sometimes, unscripted incentives are up to the discretion of a local commissioner or panel.

Post, animation, and SFX qualify for incentives in some jurisdictions, regardless of whether you’re doing any actual filming there.

Most places have minimum local spending requirements. Some may require a minimum number of filming days in the jurisdiction, too, and/or a minimum number (or percentage) of local hires.

So as a first step, check to see whether your content qualifies.

# How far in Advance Do I Have to Apply?

Deadlines are all over the place and depend on the jurisdiction.

For example, Ohio has just two application windows a year. The 2024 application period for the Yukon opens on March 18; they’ll continue to accept applications and distribute funds until they hit their yearly funding cap. If that happens before you apply, you could be shut out of funds for the year.

Many places require applications 60 to 90 days before principal photography, while others may accept applications even after filming has begun.

If you’re interested in an incentives program, make sure you look into application deadlines or you could miss out.

# What Expenses Actually Qualify?

Generally speaking, a cost has to be incurred within the jurisdiction to qualify. So renting equipment from a local vendor could save you a tidy sum over renting it outside the jurisdiction and bringing it in.

Travel costs qualify in some places (especially if booked through a local agent), but not others. Same with out-of-state/foreign labor: depending on the program, those costs could qualify for the full incentive, at a lower rate, or not at all.

Most jurisdictions have a detailed list of what qualifies, like [this one](https://dor.georgia.gov/list-film-tax-credit-expenditures) for the state of Georgia. Careful planning can help you maximize savings – and keep you from counting on receiving money back on expenses that don’t qualify.

# When Will I See the Money?

The timeline depends on the type of incentive (check out our earlier post on the subject [here](https://www.productionincentivesinsider.com/p/refundable-transferable-rebatewhat)). Rebates and grants often pay out fastest, followed by transferable tax incentives if you’re selling them. But you could be waiting over a year (or more) to see money from a refundable tax incentive.

# Are there Any Costs I’m Overlooking?

Some jurisdictions will have an application fee, and many require an audit, which isn’t cheap.

Make sure you’re considering _**all**_ costs to determine whether an incentive is worth pursuing.

# Are there Any Bonuses or Extras I Should Consider?

It’s possible.

Various jurisdictions offer bonuses, or “**uplifts**,” if your project meets certain criteria.

New Mexico’s base credit of 25% can swell to 40% with [uplifts](https://nmfilm.com/incentives-2) that include:

- an extra 10% for filming more than 60 miles from Santa Fe and Albuquerque
    
- an extra 5% for TV series and pilots that meet [specific conditions](https://nmfilm.com/incentives-2)
    
- an extra 5% for using qualified in-state production facilities (like soundstages)
    

Planning ahead and simply shifting a shoot location could substantially increase your incentive.

[Mongolia](https://filmmongolia.gov.mn/incentives/incentives-for-global-producers/)’s base 30% rebate could return even more given their 10% bonus for culturally relevant content and 5% foreign talent reimbursement.

Some producers may rule out an incentive because their project doesn’t meet the **required minimum local spend**. But some programs, like [Georgia’s](https://www.georgia.org/industries/film-entertainment/georgia-film-tv-production/production-incentives), allow companies to **bundle their spending** across multiple productions to meet their threshold. For jurisdictions where the level of the incentive increases with your local spend, bundling could push you into a higher bracket and save you even more.

Jurisdictions often offer **informal money-saving benefits** to productions, too, like free assistance with location scouting or media rates on accommodations and vehicle rentals. It never hurts to ask.

# What about foreign/out-of-state Labor – Can I Collect an Incentive on that Cost?

This depends heavily on the jurisdiction.

In some, the incentive applies; in others, foreign/out-of-state labor qualifies at a reduced rate. It may depend on the role. Occasionally, a salary cap may apply.

In any case, be sure to check the specifics. It might make great financial sense to hit up that local labor pool!

Note that some jurisdictions require foreign/out-of-state labor to register and pay local payroll taxes. A payroll service like [Entertainment Partners](https://www.ep.com/payroll-and-residuals/), [Extreme Reach](https://ps.extremereach.com/), [Cast & Crew](https://www.castandcrew.com/), or [Wrapbook](https://www.wrapbook.com/platform/payroll) (among others) can help streamline the process.

# Is there a Limit to how much a Single Project Can Receive?

Almost always!

Keep an eye out for caps, which may include:

- caps on the total amount a single project can receive
- annual caps on the total amount of funds the jurisdiction has available for a given period
- caps for specific spending categories (like talent and crew salaries)

As you compare incentives programs, pay careful attention to any caps that might limit the amount your project could receive.

# What’s All This Talk about a “cultural test”?

If you’ve looked into international incentives, you may have seen references to a “cultural test,” like [this one](https://www.bfi.org.uk/apply-british-certification-tax-relief/cultural-test-film) for the UK, or Malaysia’s, in Appendix C of [this document](https://www.filminmalaysia.com/app/uploads/2016/12/GUIDE02-GUIDELINES-FIMI-Foreign-Production-00812916.pdf).

People often mistakenly believe that their project needs to be 100% editorially focused on a country or culture in order to pass the cultural test, but that isn’t _entirely_ true.

The cultural test usually evaluates a project in **three areas:**

1. Favorable portrayal of the jurisdiction while featuring its locations and/or recognizable destinations.
2. Inclusion of cultural elements like food, wine, language, and local traditions.
3. Use of local on-camera talent and/or crew in designated roles.

Cutural tests often award **points** for each category, so your project may still pass even if it doesn’t nail all three categories.

If you’re planning to target a particular incentive, it’s important to review the cultural test and plan accordingly. I know of at least one unscripted project that missed out on an incentive worth hundreds of thousands of dollars because they hired a DP from the US instead of the EU. If you’re not doing your research, **a single decision like this** **could cost you.**

# Who Applies for the incentive…the Production Company, Network, or…?

This varies.

Sometimes, a local entity must apply. That may mean applying through a local service provider. Alternatively, a production company may be able to easily set up a local entity of their own.

In other cases, a production company can apply even if they’re foreign/out of state. Occasionally, it might make sense for the broadcaster/streamer/studio to apply instead—especially if they have a tax liability in the jurisdiction that allows them to take full advantage of any tax credits, and/or if they’re able to bundle a number of productions from different production companies that individually don’t meet minimum spend requirements.
