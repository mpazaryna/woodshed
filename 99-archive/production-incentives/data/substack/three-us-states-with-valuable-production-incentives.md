# Budgets for Content Have Never Been Tighter

# Yet Many Unscripted Producers Continue to Ignore a Valuable Source of Potential Funding, at Their Own Peril: Production Incentives

Mention incentives to producers of unscripted content (e.g. documentary, lifestyle, factual, reality) and they might shrug, thinking they’re only for big budget scripted productions.

Or that they’re too complicated. Or simply not worth the hassle.

But when it comes to filming in the US, there are **dozens** of states (and even counties and cities) that offer **substantial incentives** you might not be aware of—and **unscripted content qualifies.**

If you’re an industry veteran who’s never tapped incentives, why bother learning about them now?

**Because as you continue to ignore them, your competition isn’t.**

**And guess what?** They’re pitching similar content, to the same networks and streamers, at an incentives-subsidized lower price point — at a time when **everyone’s tightening their programming budgets**.

**Who do think is going to land that greenlight?**

**But fear not!** We’re here to guide you.

But it offers plenty more to get the creative juices flowing, including cities, ghost towns…and let’s not forget [this place](https://www.newmexico.org/places-to-visit/regions/southeast/roswell/).
