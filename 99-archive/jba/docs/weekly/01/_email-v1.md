## Mimaki Europe

The Leading provider of industrial inkjet printers, cutting platters, and 3D printers, announced the launch of a fully UV print and cut solution, consisting of the large format flatbed UV printer ifx600-2531 and the flatbed cutting plotter the cfx 2531.

The flatbed UV printer, JFX600-2531, responds to market demand for a larger print size, following the positive reception of the JFX600-2513 launched in 2021. Offering the same high levels of productivity and maximum resolution of 1,200 dpi, the increased print-bed size of 3.1m in length opens up new possibilities for printers, particularly in architectural applications. Due to the expanded print-bed, the JFX600-2531 is able to print directly on commonly used architectural substrates, such as glass and plywood, which have a standard size of 3,000mm. Printing on these substrates commonly involve applying a printed film onto the surface, so direct printing allows for the original surface texture of the substrate to remain, excluding the design area.  

## Agfa

Agfa unveiled its enhanced and rebranded inkjet printer portfolio, featuring three new machines, at Fespa Global Print Expo under the tagline ‘Powerful by Nature’, the manufacturer said its printers have been given a fresh identity, “now sporting names of formidable animals that reflect their unique strengths”.

The launch of this machine – a rebadged version of the EFI Vutek Q5r but with an Agfa service and workflow package – follows Agfa and EFI’s announcement earlier this year that they had joined forces to expand their respective product ranges by adding OEM machines to their portfolios. Also new from Agfa is the Jeti Bronco H3300 S, a 3.3m-wide high-end UV-LED printer that prints a variety of sign and display jobs at up to 248sqm/hr in six colours (CMYK/Lc/Lm) plus white, with optional primer.
