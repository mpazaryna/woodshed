# eVideon Banner Digital Signage

Banner uses your logo, colors and branding to broadcast your most important messages and information. Show educational videos in public areas, display the daily menu in the cafeteria or help people find their way. Videos, widgets and information are available wherever they’re needed.
Banner displays can be grouped in any configuration (by floor, unit, ward, individually, etc.), with different views and information on each group. Widgets like news tickers, weather, or bus schedules give patients, staff, and visitors up-to-the-minute information.
‍
Banner’s presentation builder lets anyone easily build presentations and playlists. The solution uses a simple drag-and-drop editor - no formal training is needed. Easily incorporate other eVideon features, such as health education content or Harmonia relaxation content into public displays. As always, you can use your own content or "home grown" materials.

Options include but are not limited to:
‍
Yes. Banner is a great way to display maps or directions.
Yes. Your Banner solution will be branded with your logo, colors, and imagery, and displays can be grouped together or display information individually. For example, cardiac units can display heart health videos while pediatric floors can display family programming.
You and your team have complete control of your signage solution via a simple drag-and-drop editor that doesn’t require extensive training.
While we do recommend a power source at each location, Banner can run on WiFi, so it does not require Ethernet connectivity.
