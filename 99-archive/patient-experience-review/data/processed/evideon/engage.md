# eVideon Engage Interactive Patient TV

Hospitalized patients spend most of their time watching TV. It’s a great way for patients to relax, but it’s also a great opportunity to engage them in their care. eVideon Engage leverages the TV to prompt timely, meaningful interaction with patients, while providing a supportive and relaxing environment.
The TV can greet patients by their preferred name as they enter their room while customized calming content plays, setting the tone for a stay that’s as relaxing and restful as possible with personal touches. Engage helps communicate that patients are recognized not just as patients, but as people.

‍
Engage can integrate fully with your EMR and ADT systems. That means patient education can be automatically assigned based on admission triggers (data such as floor, unit or diagnosis). It can be assigned manually by clinical staff or assigned directly from within your EMR and documented back into the EMR.


Surveys prompt patients to provide real-time feedback for service recovery. Survey questions help you efficiently ensure patients’ rooms are clean, services are delivered timely, and patients are comfortable. If a patient reports dissatisfaction, notifications can be routed to the right person or department to address issues quickly.


Through an RTLS interface, Engage displays the name, picture and role of the person entering the patient's room.


Handbooks, channel guides, welcome videos, food menus and more can be digitally displayed on the system, eliminating the need for paper handouts that are expensive and easily lost. Updates can be made and displayed in real time without costly reprints, and patients can view information in their preferred language.


Engage integrates with your meal ordering software, giving patients the opportunity to order their meals using their TV and pillow speaker. Meal options are displayed for each patient based on their specific dietary orders. If a patient has exceeded their nutritional guidelines, the system displays the details and offers other choices. This process saves the dietary team from having to enter every room each time, preserving PPE and creating efficiencies.

Relieve nurse call button fatigue and give patients a way to request non-clinical items or services. Patients can easily request pastoral care, room cleanup, help out of bed, a therapy dog, or anything else you’d like to offer. The patient uses their pillow speaker to request the item or service. The request bypasses the nurse and goes directly to the department who can help.
