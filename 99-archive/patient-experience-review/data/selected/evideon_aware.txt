# eVideon Aware

Improving patient and workforce safety is one of the top priorities for today's healthcare leaders. Technology can close safety gaps by delivering accurate and reliable information to the right people, at the right time throughout the healthcare journey.
Aware digital door signs are designed to keep patients, staff, and visitors properly informed. Dynamic displays outside of the patient room provide real-time access to critical health information, helping hospitals prevent costly mistakes and improve care coordination.
Aware integrates with your EMR to display real-time precautions and alerts such as required PPE, fall risk, isolation status, active service requests, staff in the room, and more. The interface is fully customizable to support clinical workflow and the unique needs of our client organizations.
Using ambient backlit frames, hospitals can display color coded lighting to communicate with staff even from a distance to eliminate potential safety risks.
High reliability is a success factor in clinical quality, patient experience, and patient safety. For healthcare leaders, the high-reliability journey requires a commitment to error prevention and continuous improvement of work systems.
