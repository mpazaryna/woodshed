# Interactive Patient Software | Platform | pCare Solutions

Ready to provide a better healthcare experience for both patients, doctors, and nurses? Our interactive Patient Care System (IPS) allows you to create data-driven CareFlows via your EHR and seamlessly integrates with other systems.
Automatically leverages EHR data and makes it easy for patients to understand their care plans with relevant educational content based on diagnoses, treatment plans, prescribed medications, and discharge prescriptions.
In-room digital whiteboards give patients information about their care team, as well as daily schedule, and medications, while informing the care team of the patient’s personal preferences. pCare VideoConnect provides easy interactions between patients, physicians, interpreters, and family.
Proactive patient messaging delivered automatically via on-screen TV display notifies patients of a care process or an action to complete, optimizing care team time.
Comprehensive entertainment options help patients recharge, refocus, and relieve stress including on-demand videos and shows, relaxation programs, games, audiobooks and even photo sharing with family and friends.
