# Pediatric Solutions - pCare Interactive Patient System

Home > Solutions > Pediatric Solutions
Easily deploy our specialized user interface and accompanying content that are curated and controlled just for pediatrics.  pCare Pediatrics solutions can be configured across Children’s Hospitals as well as on specific floors, units, or rooms in hospitals caring for all demographics.
Our pediatrics interface features customized, age-appropriate portals designed especially for youth. Children and their families are served specialized welcome messages, interactive on-screen displays, and user tips specific to their demographic.
Empower your patients with education targeted to specific age groups through carefully curated pediatric language and imagery. We’ve partnered with experts such as Health Nuts Media and The Wellness Network to design pediatric health education that’s engaging while also providing parents adequate information about their child’s health journey.
We offer pediatric specific entertainment options, along with parental controls to limit access to programming. Our connectivity capabilities allow adolescent patients to access the pCare System from their own device – preserving their ability to use social media throughout their care. Additionally, you have the option to connect gaming consoles into the pCare System to provide more entertainment options.
