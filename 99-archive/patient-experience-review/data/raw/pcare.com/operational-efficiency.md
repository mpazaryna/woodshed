pCare helps you improve productivity and reduce costs by delivering effective care through efficient processes. Empowering patients to make informed decisions allows providers to practice at the top of their license. With real-time feedback, staff can quickly identify and address areas that may be great candidates for operational improvements.
pCare streamlines your care delivery to help you serve your patients exactly what they need – and reduce time spent performing unnecessary or repetitive tasks. From better incorporation of feedback to automated CareFlows admissions, pCare helps improve efficiency and care.
Available CareFlows include:
Bring down readmission through education, feedback and discharge tools built into the patient experience.
Our service recovery opportunities are created through user-friendly patient surveys via the Interactive Patient System or a pCare rounding tool. Smart data compilation results in improved HCAPHS scores and better patient-provider communication.
Reassign non-clinical care and admin tasks through the IPS system so your staff can focus on patient care. For example, education CareFlows leverage data in the EHR to select education for a patient and installed environmental and dietary controls allow patients to control their own comfort settings and meals.
Through educating patients and engaging them on their healthcare journey, you can reduce their length of stay. Preparing patients for post-op recovery can deliver up to a 25% decrease in length of stay.
Monitor and control medication adherence through pCare Ambulatory, a mobile application  that connects patients and providers outside of the hospital.
Improve patient safety through fall prevention and infection control education CareFlows and rounding reinforcement surveys.
Meds-to-Beds allows delivery of prescription medications to patients prior to discharge and Welcome CareFlows provides direct access to hospital programs and amenities.
