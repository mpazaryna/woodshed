“A lot of the technology is really focused on empowering patients to participate in their care or empowering the provider to more seamlessly provide information to the patient about their care. If you think about a typical whiteboard or grease board in a patient room… we’ve integrated that with our electronic health record, so that information is kept in real-time.”
