# pCare IPS Platform - pCare Interactive Patient System

Our customers consistently rank us higher than every other provider in every single IPS metric.
All in, pCare’s Award-Winning IPS can be up to 50% less expensive than the leading competitor.
We personally deliver on our entire product – from hardware to software.
“pCare was incredible during the implementation. They came on campus and installed TVs in every patient room in a matter of months, and we are a large hospital. It was seamless and professional, and they made sure that they were cognizant of infection control practices while installing the TVs in patient rooms. We just could not be happier. They considered everything, from the leadership learning about the product to training the staff. They were here to help with the patients as well.”
