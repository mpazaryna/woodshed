# Technology Solutions - pCare Interactive Patient System

Home > Solutions > Technology Solutions
pCare transformed hospital television systems into communication hubs – but that’s only scratching the surface of our access capabilities. We offer universal access through a host of devices and technology to connect your entire facility. From infusion centers to emergency departments to beyond the walls of your facility, pCare keeps you seamlessly connected.
Leverage pCare’s capabilities to keep patients and facilities better connected through pCare Connect API. This proprietary technology allows you to integrate multiple systems and streamline care.
See how SSM Health successfully opened a new smart hospital campus powered by pCare connectivity.
Additionally, pCare Connect API allows facilities to leverage pCare functionality in their own developed apps and portals. It simplifies integration with all manner of HIT in use today, including:
Device Manager
Event Manager
Media Manager
Patient Manager
Patient Messaging
Clinical Intelligence Engine
JMS Topics
With Mobile Device Management in place, you can add flexibility to how you deploy pCare throughout your facility while improving patient experience with easier access to games, internet browsing and more.
pCare pairs easily with personal devices so patients can freely use their own phone or tablet to navigate their health journey. They can view education during and after admission, control entertainment on the TV, order a meal, or launch a VideoConnect session. Additionally, they can access their care team and daily schedule, make a service request and manage their room’s lighting and temperature – all from the device they are already familiar with. Plus, pCare runs on any device, no downloads required.
pCare integrates with Alexa devices so patients can control their TV with simple voice commands. Now patients can ask their TV to turn on, select a specific station or movie, control the volume, view education videos and more.
