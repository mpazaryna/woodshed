Home > About > Careers
Attracting great talent is only half the challenge. We know that growing teams and nurturing the leaders of tomorrow is what will sustain us well into the future. We recognize the challenge, and work tirelessly each day to create a culture of diversity and inclusiveness, opportunity, and integrity; a workplace that our employees tell us “Feels Like Family”.
pCare was founded as TVR Communications in 1950 in New York City, providing television rental services to patients in local hospitals with an inventory of 10 black and white television sets.   Seven decades later, we stand today at the premier provider of Interactive Patient Care Systems (IPS)  for health care systems across the nation –  creating a communication hub for patients, families, and providers designed to deliver better outcomes and experiences for all stakeholders.     We invite you to join our team as we continue to create engagement solutions that drive collaborative care across the healthcare ecosystem.
We are committed to maintaining a culture of inclusiveness, diversity, and respect for all of our employees regardless of race, religion, gender, sexual identity, or cultural background. We recognize that the diversity of our team mirrors the diversity of our clients, which helps us more effectively understand their financial challenges and meet their needs. Below are just a few things we do to support and grow a culture of diversity and respect.
