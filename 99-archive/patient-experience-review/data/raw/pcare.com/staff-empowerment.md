# Staff Empowerment to Advance Collaboration | pCare

Home > Solutions > Staff Empowerment
pCare’s Collaborative Care approach increases patient involvement in their own care, which frees your staff to spend more time doing what they are trained to do. By empowering patients to manage their own non-clinical requests, your staff can complete rounding and respond to patients faster. This renewed focus on care improves care quality, boosts productivity and increases your HCAHPS results.
Prepare the patient for what is ahead through automated patient education CareFlows.  This streamlines caregiver consultations because the patient is not receiving the information for the first time, setting the stage for a more meaningful interaction.  The end result, better prepared,  more confident patients and more efficient communications.
Let patients manage their non-clinical needs, freeing staff to focus on care.
