With capabilities to improve patient satisfaction and care efficiency, VideoConnect will transform your healthcare operations
VideoConnect allows patients to video chat with friends and family – all from your existing pCare TV infrastructure. Without any need for staff facilitation, patients and loved ones can easily keep in touch. Friends and family can even check on patients who are asleep or uncommunicative.
Without any additional hardware, staff can launch a video session with remote interpreters to facilitate better communication with family caregivers, physicians and nurses. Workflow configuration routes to internal interpreter resources first before third-party contractors or vendors.
Limit contact and accommodate schedules by conducting rounds over existing TVs. Nurses, doctors, leaders, social workers and patient advocates can now have meaningful encounters even without close contact.
With our integrations to scheduling within the EHR, sending reminders, and facilitating one click session initiation; our secure, HIPAA compliant virtual care platform allows your care team to efficiently consult with patients, explain options and next steps, capture consents, and automatically document back into the EHR. And only pCare leverages the power of the interactive patient care system TV to deliver enhanced and no-hassle telepresence consults directly to patients in your hospital.
Telehealth is here to stay. So invest in a trusted provider that allows you to scale to your future needs. By using the platform you’ve already invested in, pCare VideoConnect is quickly deployed with minimal disruption. With no need for new hardware, VideoConnect is cost-effective and easy for staff to use.
