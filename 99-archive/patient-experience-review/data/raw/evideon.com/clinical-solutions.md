# Clinical Solutions - Inpatient and Outpatient | eVideon

The eVideon system helps clinicians engage their patients in
their care while in the hospital, as well as prepare them for discharge and
care at home. This engagement empowers patients in their own care, enhancing
their hospital experience and improving long-term outcomes.
Patients and their family members or caregivers can watch
unit-specific videos, videos specific to their condition, as well as wellness
and safety videos. By providing patients with an individualized educational plan on managing their condition,
medication and self-care, patients are more informed and better prepared to
take over their care at discharge.
eVideon can help you build a Health Education Library covering a
broad range of topics, including conditions, medications, procedures, discharge
instructions and wellness. You can choose from several high-quality,
evidence-based educational content providers to match your needs.
From a care team perspective, eVideon is simple to manage.
Patient education can be assigned through a bidirectional integration with your
EHR without adding steps to the clinical team's workflow. eVideon can also
document education progress, giving time back to the clinical team.
eVideon provides patients with literacy challenges a better understanding
of their education. A review that examined the effectiveness of videos in
modifying health behaviors found videos better facilitate change in behavior
over written instructions.
Patients can review their assigned education multiple times with
family members or caregivers to ensure they fully understand their care,
medications, diagnosis and preparations for lifestyle changes after
discharge.
The time clinical staff
spends on education with their patients can be focused on the patient.
Clinicians can address the patient's concerns and questions about their hospital
experience and lifestyle changes they will face after discharge, helping to
empower the patient to take charge of their health and be compliant
while at home.
Patients can easily make non-medical service requests through
the eVideon system like order a meal or give feedback on their
hospital experience, including quietness at night and room
temperature. The result: calls to the clinical team are reduced.
Studies show that patients who have access to entertainment
and relaxation content place fewer nurse calls for pain medication and service
related needs, freeing up the clinical team to focus on patient care.
With eVideon, new moms can watch on demand videos while caring for their baby. A mom can simply pause her educational video and pick it up again where she left off or review the material as needed. Video education is an important step in helping prepare new mothers for discharge and caring for their baby and themselves at home.
A new mom can easily make non-medical service requests through the eVideon system like order a meal or give feedback on experience – quietness, room temperature through interactive surveys and have her concerns addressed in real time. Plus, videos and games are perfect for keeping visiting family members entertained.
eVideon’s customized design and branding for children provides easy
navigation of menus and access to pediatric education content for the patient
and their parents.
Content filtering is available to assure parents their
children will be entertained with age-appropriate gaming, music and videos.
Internet access allows children with long-term hospital stays to connect to the
outside world and stay in touch with their teachers and friends.
Young patients and their siblings are entertained and occupied
with on demand videos and television. Patients can even use their gaming
systems, iPads, laptops and other touchscreen displays with a plug and play device.
In units with a unique patient population like ICU, eVideon provides
a quiet, relaxing environment for the patient while allowing family members to access entertainment and educational content.
Research shows that a relaxing environment can positively impact
a patient’s recovery. eVideon’s Harmonia channel provides an HD visual
experience, as well as soothing instrumental music to help the patient relax.
To help patients sleep or to prevent waking a sleeping patient,
eVideon's quiet at night feature provides a soft night light with ambient noise,
reducing distractions and the effects of hospital noise.
ICU patients or family can access eVideon’s patient
education to help them understand what to expect during their loved one’s
hospital stay and prepare them for lifestyle changes that will be required upon
discharge.
Patients with limited mobility are often unable to control their television system. Being unable to operate the TV can add to an already frustrating experience. eVideon provides an interface between Sip-and-Puff and Facial Sensor equipment to give these patients the ability to control their eVideon system and communicate with caregivers.
On demand movies like comedies release endorphins, helping
patients de-stress and relax before surgery. A review that examined the
effectiveness of videos in modifying health behaviors found they can better
facilitate change in behavior over written instructions.
Animations and anatomy visualizations are also helpful tools
that clinical staff can use to answer patient questions and ensure the patient
has an in-depth understanding of their procedure.
Research shows that when patients have access to a relaxing
environment, they experience a faster recovery from anesthesia and need
less pain medication. eVideon's Harmonia solution uses the beauty of
nature combined with musical compositions to provide a calm and
relaxing environment for the patient during recovery.
eVideon helps create a pleasant experience for patients throughout
their hospital stay. Patients who are waiting for admission or who are further
along in their recovery and waiting for discharge can also access eVideon’s entertainment
features.
For patients who need Dialysis or infusion, eVideon’s
entertainment options can make these visits more pleasant and
comfortable. eVideon’s swing arm and tablet solutions are perfect for outpatient
facilities where patients may be in close proximity to one another.
In the emergency department, the eVideon system meets education needs while
the patient is waiting for test results or completion of their treatment.
A study on the effectiveness of videos in health behavior modification
uncovered that videos are better at facilitating behavior change than written
instructions. eVideon also provides entertainment to patients while they are in
the emergency department, enhancing their overall experience.
If patients are admitted to the hospital from the emergency department, the
eVideon experience follows them throughout their hospital stay – so their
education progress and entertainment goes with them.
eVideon' Digital Signage feature is a great way to communicate messages on healthy living, disease prevention, community programs, events and more. eVideon’s Digital Signage module includes video and messaging for a powerful presentation.
Televisions can be grouped to ease the process of assigning presentations and scheduling for outpatient waiting rooms or inpatient visitor waiting rooms. You could schedule the news to be shown from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m., then show live HD television or movies. Branded messages can be added as well as messages in a ticker along the bottom. eVideon can also integrated with RTLS, to individualize the patient's experience while in the exam room.
Tablets using the eVideon system can be used to provide valuable
patient education to patients while they are in the exam room. Animations and
anatomy visualizations are also helpful tools that clinical staff can use to
ensure the patient has an in-depth understanding of their
diagnosis, procedures or to answer patient questions.
