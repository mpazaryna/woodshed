Join clinical experts from OhioHealth, eVideon & Caregility to explore the future of virtual nursing, including the benefits of integrating in-room technology with virtual care.
eVideon provides patients, their families and visitors with more options, enjoyment and control during their stay. With eVideon's bedside solution, patients are entertained, engaged and educated, improving experience and outcomes.
The eVideon system utilizing patient education videos and interactive learning leads patients and their families through their education journey. Patients and family can learn about their diagnosis, what to expect during their hospital stay, how to engage in their own care, and how to care for themselves after discharge.
eVideon integrates with your hospital's electronic health record system to assign media and personalize the patient’s language, options and views. Tools are integrated into the EHR, making it easy for nurses to begin the education process, see video viewing history and assessment results.
Hospitals see an immediate increase in patient satisfaction
after implementing an eVideon IPTV system. Patients know how to care for
themselves in the hospital and at home, leading to reduced readmissions and
better patient safety. Integrations with hospital systems, food service and nurse
call boost efficiency throughout the hospital.
Veterans have unique needs. To help meet these needs, hospitals, VA Medical Centers and clinics are providing education through our automated, bidirectional integration with VistA and the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS).
eVideon delivers HD television over an Ethernet network. Live channels, video on demand, educational media and a rich user interface are delivered seamlessly to televisions, computers and touch displays.
