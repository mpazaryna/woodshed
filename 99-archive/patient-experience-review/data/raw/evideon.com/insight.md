# eVideon Insight Digital Whiteboards

eVideon Insight integrates directly with your EMR in real time so you can be sure information is accurate and reliable. Nurses no longer have to spend valuable time updating dry erase boards, double checking information and replacing old markers. Customize the layout to display the following:
• Patient’s assigned care team
• Safety precautions
• Daily schedule
• Goals or tasks
• Medications
• Estimated discharge date
• Pain scale
Patients and caregivers can communication more effectively and efficiently with their nurses and physicians with Insight's interactive features. Using their pillow speaker handset, Companion Tablet, or even their personal phone or device, they can share their goals, ask a question, or offer insights into their personal preferences to help make their stay more comfortable.

In partnership with E Ink, Insight can use the same energy saving technologies as eReaders for better usability and to keep patient rooms dim while patients rest. Digital paper provides:
• High visibility from all angles
• Zero light pollution
• Low power consumption
• Can run on power over Ethernet


Patients can bring up a full-screen whiteboard with the touch of a button, or can view information without exiting their TV or movie. Insight can also be a standalone display, separate from the Engage patient TV console.
The Insight display is based on real-time activity in the hospital. For example, when a care team member enters the room, real-time location system (RTLS) integration can allow a pop-up to display, notifying the patient who has entered the room. Similarly, Insight can display completed rounds based on actual rounding activity.

You choose the information you wish to display on your Insight whiteboards. The interface and modules are fully customizable to include your logo, branding, and desired patient-facing information.

Yes. Insight’s features can be displayed on Companion Tablets, or on request on the patient’s Engage TV. We have also partnered with E Ink to deliver in-room wall displays that don’t emit light (zero light pollution) and are extremely energy efficient. This drastically reduces the “screen stress” in patient rooms.
Yes. Insight can display content in any language automatically based on information in your EMR. Patients can also change the display language at any time.
