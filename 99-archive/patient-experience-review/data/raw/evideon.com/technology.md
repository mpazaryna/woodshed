# Technology - Forward Thinking IPTV | eVideon

eVideon Universal allows your healthcare organization to use the full suite of eVideon products across different devices, platforms, operating systems, and infrastructure, including IPTV Ethernet and RF Coaxial networks.
eVideon’s future-proof solution uses equipment and services that are common knowledge to hospital IT staff. The result is a scalable system that's easy to deploy and maintain.
Adding a TV location in one building is just as easy as adding a TV in another.
Every TV and every site in a health system is managed through one central web based application.
Distributed architecture allows Video on Demand (VoD) to be served up from a local point of presence rather than unnecessarily taking up bandwidth over your backbone or WAN links.
When eVideon is installed in your hospital or health system it reflects your goals, quality of care and branding initiatives, which are important elements for delivering an exceptional experience to patients. TV locations can be grouped into zones organized by building, floor, unit or any desired grouping. This flexible architecture allows you to provide customized experiences for your patients.
