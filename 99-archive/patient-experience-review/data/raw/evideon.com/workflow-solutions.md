# Workflow Solutions - Streamline Hospital Workflows | eVideon

As a result of using eVideon, healthcare organizations experience more time to dedicate toward patient care, and they are reporting an immediate improvement in patient satisfaction.
Designed to integrate with EHRs, eVideon streamlines workflows by automating education and compliance tasks, such as automatically assigning education videos to a patient after an education need has been documented in the EHR. This allows the clinical staff to spend time with the patient that is more focused on answering specific questions the patient might have about their care, rather than explaining basic concepts of the patient care.
The interface gives patients access to features within their eVideon experience. This can be customized by hospital, floor or unit – or by patient demographics, such as age or condition. Seniors can select a view with larger fonts and bigger buttons with access to Medicare. Children and their parents view bright colors and engaging graphics as well as a pediatric health library.
Non-clinical patient service requests, such as
emptying the trash or requesting a chaplain visit,
can be completed through eVideon and sent
directly to the appropriate staff member. This can            significantly streamline workflows, allowing for more efficient staffing.
Non-medical service requests like “I need a blanket” are routed directly to the appropriate staff members, creating more time for patient care. This reduces patient wait times and increases staff efficiencies.
Interactive surveys alert staff if a patient has a housekeeping request. Hospitals may have areas where the temperature varies; surveys can let staff know when patients need room temperature adjustments, so they can rest comfortably.
The HCAHPS question, “During this hospital stay, how often was the area around your room quiet at night?” Is one of the lowest ranking HCAHPS questions. Patient survey results can uncover the times of day that are noisy or squeaky carts that need replacing.
eVideon workflows start preparing your patients and their family
for discharge from the first day of their admission. Patients and their
families will learn what is expected of them on discharge, which helps
prevent the confusion or anxiety that can come with returning home after a
hospital stay.
Patients
and their families can prepare and ask questions about topics on their
Discharge Readiness Questionnaire, which allows the clinical team to spend time
with the patient that’s more personal and address their concerns. This
preparation helps the patient be more compliant with their post-hospital care
and results in better outcomes.
By integrating your nutrition services software into eVideon, your hospital reduces staff needs while increasing accuracy and timeliness. Patients and families can order meals, snacks and guest trays right from their bed. If a patient is on a restricted diet before surgery, their food choices will be filtered so they don’t see the menu items that aren’t a part of their diet. Automating meal ordering also allows your hospital to reduce printing costs and can help with infection prevention efforts.
Surveys are a leading indicator of patient satisfaction scores and provide a proactive means to improve a patient’s experience during their stay. With our Care Team Application, clinical staff can access a patient's discharge progress and uncover potential causes for future readmissions. Your Leadership Rounding initiatives can use the data collected from the interactive surveys to easily identify areas where nurses and team leaders need support, so improvements can be implemented.
Instant messages facilitate efficient and fast communication; patients send messages to clinical staff and receive a response on their screen. Patients become actively engaged in their care and aware of their progress while being reassured that their concerns will be addressed quickly.
