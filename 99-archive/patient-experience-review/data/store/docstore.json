Technology can close safety gaps by delivering accurate and reliable information to the right people, at the right time throughout the healthcare journey.\nAware digital door signs are designed to keep patients, staff, and visitors properly informed. Dynamic displays outside of the patient room provide real-time access to critical health information, helping hospitals prevent costly mistakes and improve care coordination.\nAware integrates with your EMR to display real-time precautions and alerts such as required PPE, fall risk, isolation status, active service requests, staff in the room, and more. The interface is fully customizable to support clinical workflow and the unique needs of our client organizations.\nUsing ambient backlit frames, hospitals can display color coded lighting to communicate with staff even from a distance to eliminate potential safety risks.\nHigh reliability is a success factor in clinical quality, patient experience, and patient safety. For healthcare leaders, the high-reliability journey requires a commitment to error prevention and continuous improvement of work systems.\nWatch this on demand webinar to hear from safety and high reliability expert, Craig Clapper, PE as he explore the characteristics of high reliability organizations (HROs) and how smart room technology unlocks the power of high reliability in healthcare.
