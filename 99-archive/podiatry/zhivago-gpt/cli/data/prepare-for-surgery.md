# Preparing for Orthopedic Surgery

## Medical Evaluation

- Before surgery, you'll likely undergo a thorough medical evaluation to ensure you're fit for the procedure. This might include blood tests, X-rays, and other diagnostic tests.
- Discuss any medications you're taking with your doctor, as you might need to stop or adjust some before surgery.

## Physical Therapy

- Some patients benefit from pre-operative physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around the surgery site, aiding recovery.

## Diet and Nutrition

- Eating a balanced diet can help boost your immune system and speed up recovery.
- Some surgeons may recommend specific vitamins or supplements.

## Avoid Smoking and Alcohol

- Smoking can delay bone healing and increase the risk of complications.
- Alcohol can interfere with medications and increase bleeding risks.

## Home Preparation

- Consider making modifications to your home to make post-surgery life easier. This might include setting up a bedroom on the ground floor, installing grab bars in the bathroom, or securing a shower chair.
- Stock up on essentials so you don't need to make frequent trips to the store post-surgery.

## Plan for Assistance

- You might need help with daily tasks after surgery, so arrange for a family member, friend, or caregiver to assist you.

## Know the Procedure

- Understand the specifics of your surgery, potential risks, and the expected recovery timeline. This will help set realistic expectations.

## Mental Preparation

- It's natural to feel anxious. Consider techniques like meditation, deep breathing exercises, or counseling to help manage pre-surgery anxiety.

## Day Before Surgery

- Follow any specific instructions from your surgeon. This might include fasting or using a special antiseptic soap.
- Pack a bag for the hospital with essentials like pajamas, slippers, personal care items, and any devices you might need (like hearing aids or glasses).

## Transportation

- Plan how you'll get to and from the hospital. You won't be able to drive immediately after surgery, so ensure you have someone to transport you.

## Post-surgery Care

- Understand the post-operative care plan, including medications, physical therapy, and follow-up appointments.
