# PPV Variability

This visualization gives a broader understanding of the PPV variability among the physicians in the dataset.

To evaluate the variability in PPV for each physician, we'll calculate the standard deviation of PPV values. A higher standard deviation indicates more significant variability in PPV, while a lower standard deviation suggests consistent PPV values across visits.

However, one challenge we might face is that the dataset provides an average PPV for each physician rather than individual PPV values for each visit. We can directly compute each physician's standard deviation of PPV values with individual visit data.

Given this limitation, we can only discuss variability in PPV in general terms, comparing average PPV values across physicians rather than within each physician's visits.

Would you like to proceed with this approach, or would you like to explore another method?

The standard deviation of PPV values across all physicians is approximately \( \$46.66 \). This indicates that, on average, individual PPV values deviate from the mean PPV value (which is \( \$129.99 \)) by about \( \$46.66 \).

In other words, the average PPV values vary roughly \( \$46.66 \) among different physicians. This can provide insight into the spread or consistency of PPV values across the dataset, though it doesn't offer details on variability within each physician's visits.

To get a clearer picture, let's visualize the distribution of PPV values for all physicians.

The histogram above shows the distribution of PPV values for all physicians. 

From the histogram, we can observe that:

- Most physicians have a PPV value around the mean, with the distribution peak close to the mean.
- A few physicians with exceptionally high PPV values are outliers and situated more than one standard deviation away from the mean.

In terms of variability:

- Physicians with PPV values close to the mean tend to have more consistent billing practices (at least in terms of average PPV values).
- Physicians with PPV values far from the mean (especially those beyond one standard deviation) exhibit more variability in their PPV values when compared to their peers.
