Hi Hal,

I've dedicated some time to delving deep into our data, experimenting with various tools, and fine-tuning the presentation. The process was genuinely engaging! I'd appreciate your reviewing my findings and sharing your insights.

One aspect that caught my attention was positioning specific PPV values in terms of percentiles. If a PPV appears considerably low, it naturally raises questions about the physician's approach or methods.

I am looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

Best,
