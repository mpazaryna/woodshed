# Adho Mukha Svanasana

Downward Facing Dog is a foundational yoga pose that resembles an inverted "V" shape. In this position, the body forms a triangle with the ground, with hands and feet pressing into the floor while the hips lift toward the ceiling.

## Key Elements for Description

1. Body position: Inverted V-shape with hands and feet on the ground, hips lifted high
2. Hand placement: Shoulders-width apart, fingers spread wide, middle fingers pointing forward
3. Foot placement: Hip-width apart, heels reaching toward the floor (may not touch)
4. Arm alignment: Straight but not locked, inner elbows facing each other
5. Leg alignment: Straight but not locked, quadriceps engaged
6. Back position: Long, flat spine with tailbone tilting up toward ceiling
7. Head position: Relaxed between the arms, neck in line with spine
8. Weight distribution: Evenly balanced between hands and feet
9. Energy lines: Extension through the spine from fingertips to tailbone and down through heels
10. Breath: Deep and steady breathing, creating space in the torso

This pose serves as both an active pose and a resting position, strengthening the upper body while stretching the hamstrings, calves, and shoulders.
