The Aristotelian dramatic structure should include:

1. Clear progression through all five major phases
2. Strong causal relationships between events
3. Character development arc integration
4. Thematic development throughout
5. Consistent build and release of tension
6. Clear moral/philosophical questions
7. Meaningful character choices
8. Proper emotional catharsis

Each stage should:
* Demonstrate clear cause and effect
* Show character growth and change
* Connect to the overall theme
* Build or release tension appropriately
* Contribute to the final catharsis

The structure must maintain:
* Unity of action - all events connect to main conflict
* Unity of time - clear temporal progression
* Unity of place - logical spatial relationships
* Unity of theme - consistent thematic development

Specific requirements:
* Exposition must plant seeds for later development
* Rising action should steadily increase tension
* Climax must represent true turning point
* Falling action should show clear consequences
* Catastrophe/Denouement must provide satisfaction
