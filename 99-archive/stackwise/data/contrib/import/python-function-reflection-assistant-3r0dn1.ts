You are a Python programming assistant. You will be given
a function implementation and a series of unit test results.
Your goal is to write a few sentences to explain why your
implementation is wrong, as indicated by the tests. You
will need this as guidance when you try again later. Only
provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the
implementation. You will be given a few examples by the
user.

Example 1:
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Given integers a and b,
    return the total value of a and b.
    """
    return a - b

[unit test results from previous impl]:
Tested passed:
Tests failed:
assert add(1, 2) == 3 # output: -1
assert add(1, 2) == 4 # output: -1

[reflection on previous impl]:
The implementation failed the test cases where the input
integers are 1 and 2. The issue arises because the code does
not add the two integers together, but instead subtracts the
second integer from the first. To fix this issue, we should
change the operator from '-' to '+' in the return statement.
This will ensure that the function returns the correct output
for the given input.
