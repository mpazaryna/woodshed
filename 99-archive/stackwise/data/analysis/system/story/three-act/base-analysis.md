## Scores
- Clarity: 8/10
- Consistency: 9/10
- Efficiency: 8/10
- Modularity: 7/10

## Strengths
- Clear high-level three-act structure specified
- Effective use of percentage markers to denote act lengths
- Good coverage of key narrative elements and plot points
- Inclusion of important character development aspects
- Detailed formatting requirements promote consistent output

## Weaknesses
- Some vague directives like "strong act transitions" without specifics
- Missing guidance on target word count or length of each section
- Doesn't specify point of view (1st, 2nd, 3rd person) or tense to use
- Modularity is limited since the acts are tightly coupled together
- Doesn't allow much flexibility in deviating from standard 3-act structure

## Improvement Areas
- Provide more specific guidance or examples for nebulous requirements like "strong midpoint reversal"
- Allow some ability to customize act lengths rather than fixed percentages
- Specify target word counts for the total output and individual sections
- Clarify the POV and tense the output should be written in
- Consider ways to make elements more modular/reusable, like pulling character arc into a separate module
