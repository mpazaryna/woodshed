## Scores
- Clarity: 8/10
- Consistency: 9/10
- Efficiency: 7/10
- Modularity: 6/10
- Total Score: 30/40

## Strengths
- Clear and specific formatting requirements
- Consistent use of percentages for story stages
- One-line character descriptions keep things concise
- Tagging makes the primitive easily searchable

## Weaknesses
