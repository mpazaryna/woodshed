## Individual Scores

### creative.md
Total Score: 30/40
- Clarity: 9/10
- Consistency: 8/10
- Efficiency: 7/10
- Modularity: 6/10

Top improvement areas:
- Provide a few short illustrative examples for the more abstract innovation techniques
- Break up longer prompts into clearer, more modular chunks focusing on one element at a time
- Restructure to reduce redundancy and overlap between different sections
- Present anti-clich√© checklist as an actual checklist with each item on a new line
- Consider adding a few "starter ideas" or launches for each area to help spark writer creativity


### requirements.md
Total Score: 33/40
- Clarity: 9/10
- Consistency: 9/10
- Efficiency: 7/10
- Modularity: 8/10

Top improvement areas:
- Quantify requirements where possible to make them more objective and measurable
- Expand the advanced elements section with the same level of detail as earlier sections
- Explicitly call out the need to avoid plot holes, contrivances, and clunky exposition
- Add pacing, narrative flow, and scene transition requirements
- Provide more detailed world-building guidance on magic, technology, geography, history, etc.
- Consider separating character and plot requirements from structure for better modularity
- Potentially organize requirements in a checklist format for ease of use and tracking


### structure.md
Total Score: 32/40
- Clarity: 8/10
- Consistency: 9/10
- Efficiency: 7/10
- Modularity: 8/10

Top improvement areas:
- Break down some of the denser sections into additional focused subsections
- Provide percentage breakdowns for key subsections, not just the high-level acts
- Include short examples for some of the key story concepts and elements
- Integrate the story element sections more directly into the relevant act breakdowns
- Consider splitting this into multiple prompts given the overall complexity


### base.md
Total Score: 32/40
- Clarity: 8/10
- Consistency: 9/10
- Efficiency: 8/10
- Modularity: 7/10

Top improvement areas:
- Provide more specific guidance or examples for nebulous requirements like "strong midpoint reversal"
- Allow some ability to customize act lengths rather than fixed percentages
- Specify target word counts for the total output and individual sections
- Clarify the POV and tense the output should be written in
- Consider ways to make elements more modular/reusable, like pulling character arc into a separate module


### improvement.md
Total Score: 30/40
- Clarity: 9/10
- Consistency: 8/10
- Efficiency: 7/10
- Modularity: 6/10

Top improvement areas:
- Add more specific examples or recommendations for tricky techniques like building better act transitions and midpoint reversals
- Include a step to strategically prioritize 2-3 improvement areas rather than trying to tackle the whole list
- Provide some diagnostic questions to help identify a story's greatest current weaknesses
- Separate the structural vs character vs thematic elements into modules to allow more targeted application
- Consider trimming or combining a few points to make the overall process more efficient and focused


### advanced.md
Total Score: 30/40
- Clarity: 8/10
- Consistency: 9/10
- Efficiency: 6/10
- Modularity: 7/10

Top improvement areas:
- Consider creating a simplified version for beginner writers that focuses on the core three act elements
- Provide brief definitions or examples for potentially unfamiliar terms and concepts
- Look for opportunities to combine or streamline related elements to improve efficiency
- Add guidance on which elements can be used independently vs which are essential to include together
- Potentially restructure into distinct modules for Character, Plot, Theme to enhance modularity


### format.md
Total Score: 30/40
- Clarity: 8/10
- Consistency: 9/10
- Efficiency: 7/10
- Modularity: 6/10

Top improvement areas:
- Streamline the tags to avoid redundant information
- Provide more detail on expected character elements and descriptions
- Specify the desired output format for the generated story
- Consider ways to make the structure more modular and flexible
- Potentially break out the formatting requirements into a separate reusable primitive
