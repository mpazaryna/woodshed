2. Develop effective setup, payoff, and cause-and-effect 
3. Integrate meaningful subplots
4. Deepen character motivations and stakes
5. Create impactful complications and climax

THEME:
1. Reinforce theme in all acts and subplots

- Aligned character and plot development
- Satisfying resolution of all major threads
- Emotionally and narratively fulfilling ending
