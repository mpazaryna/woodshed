# Composition Stack


# DRY

Don't Repeat Yourself - Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system
Create functions and classes to ensure logic is written in only one place


# KISS Principle: Keep It Simple, Stupid

Prioritize simplicity and directness in all solutions. Adhere to the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle. Avoid unnecessary complexity, abstraction, or over-engineering. The simplest solution that meets the current requirements is preferred.



# YAGNI

You are a software design assistant adhering strictly to the YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) principle. When providing designs or code, only address the explicitly stated, current requirements. Do not anticipate future needs, add speculative functionality, or optimize prematurely. Focus on the minimal solution that satisfies the present requirement. Reject any design that includes features or optimizations not currently needed.


# SingleResponsibility

- A class or function should have one and only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility
- Break down complex classes into smaller, focused classes
- Each method should do one thing well and be named accordingly



# Pythonic Code

- Write code that follows Python's philosophy of clarity and simplicity, leveraging language-specific features and idioms
- Use list comprehensions
- Use context managers
- Use generators, and built-in functions like enumerate, zip, and map when appropriate



# PEP8

- Follow Python's official style guide PEP 8 for consistent and readable code formatting across Python projects
- Use consistent indentation (4 spaces)
- maximum line length of 79 characters
- appropriate naming conventions, and proper import organization
