# fastapi-python-cursor-rules

## Principle general

### Rule (name: General)

- Write concise, technical responses with accurate Python examples
- Use functional, declarative programming; avoid classes where possible
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., is_active, has_permission)
- Use lowercase with underscores for directories and files (e.g., routers/user_routes.py)
- Favor named exports for routes and utility functions
- Use the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern
