            - requirement: Embody transformed state
            - requirement: Resolve internal conflicts
            - requirement: Apply lessons learned
  - Element: RelationshipDynamics
    - Dynamics:

        - catalysts: Characters who force difficult choices
  - Element: ProgressionMarkers
    - Internal:
        - awareness: Growing recognition of need for change
        - resistance: Internal pushback against transformation
        - acceptance: Embracing new truths and possibilities
    - External:
        - behavior: Observable changes in actions and reactions
        - relationships: Evolution of interpersonal dynamics
        - decisions: Key choices that demonstrate growth
- Implementation:
    1. Map character's initial state using CharacterFoundation elements
    2. Define clear progression through all TransformationStages
    3. Ensure each stage has concrete demonstrations of change
    4. Utilize RelationshipDynamics to create tension and support
    5. Track progress through both internal and external markers
    6. Maintain consistent psychological cause and effect
    7. Build to a transformative decision that proves character growth
    8. Show cost and reward of transformation
