# Code Refactoring Practice

Systematic process of restructuring existing computer code without changing its external behavior, focusing on improving non-functional attributes of the software

## Elements

- Core: Code Smells - identifying problematic patterns
- Core: Test Coverage - ensuring behavior preservation
- Core: Clean Code Principles - maintaining readability
- Core: Design Patterns - applying proven solutions
- Core: Continuous Integration - frequent integration of changes

## Progression

- Level: Basic method-level refactorings (Extract Method, Rename)
- Level: Class-level restructuring (Extract Class, Move Method)
- Level: Design pattern implementation (Strategy, Factory)
- Level: Architectural refactorings (Layer separation, service extraction)
- Level: Advanced system-level transformations

## Common Refactorings

- Technique: Extract Method
  - Purpose: Turn code fragment into a method with a name that explains purpose
  - When: Long method or code needs to be reused  
- Technique: Move Method
  - Purpose: Move method to class where it's most used
  - When: Method interacts more with another class
- Technique: Replace Conditional with Polymorphism
  - Purpose: Move each leg of conditional to overridden method in subclass
  - When: Complex conditional logic based on object type
- Technique: Extract Class
  - Purpose: Create new class and move relevant fields and methods
  - When: Class has multiple responsibilities

## Code Smells

- Smell: Long Method
  - Indicator: Method over 10 lines of code
  - Solution: Extract Method, Replace Temp with Query
- Smell: Feature Envy
  - Indicator: Method more interested in another class
  - Solution: Move Method, Extract Method
- Smell: Primitive Obsession
  - Indicator: Overuse of primitive types
  - Solution: Replace Data Value with Object
- Smell: Large Class
  - Indicator: Class with too many fields/methods
  - Solution: Extract Class, Extract Subclass
