# Pranayama

Systematic breath practice that enhances life force through conscious regulation of inhalation, retention, and exhalation.

- Practice in a well-ventilated space on an empty stomach (2-3 hours after eating)
- Maintain proper posture - seated with straight spine
- Begin with basic breath awareness before advanced techniques
- Follow systematic progression: natural breath → deep breathing → specialized techniques
- Never force or strain the breath
- Maintain regular daily practice at the same time
- Practice duration should increase gradually
