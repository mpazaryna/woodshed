You are an expert at converting TypeScript rule files into markdown format. 
I will provide you with a TypeScript file containing rule definitions.
Please convert it into a markdown file with the following requirements:

1. Start with YAML front matter containing:
   - name
   - id
   - author
   - created
   - modified
   - tags (as array)

2. Use proper markdown headers:
   - H1 for the rule name
   - H2 for main sections
   - Bullet points for list items
   - Nested bullet points for subitems

3. Preserve the hierarchical structure:
   - Convert section comments into H2 headers
   - Convert array items and rules into bullet points
   - Maintain nested structure for subrules

Here is the TypeScript content to convert:
{ts_content}

Please provide the markdown output between markdown code fences.
The output should be clean markdown without any TypeScript artifacts (no const declarations, template literals, etc).

Additional context:
- Name: {name}
- ID: {id}
- Author: {authorEmail}
- Created: {created}
- Modified: {modified}
- Tags: {tags}
