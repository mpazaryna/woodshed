# Stackwise

<img src="/assets/blue-teal.jpg" width="500" alt="Stackwise Logo">

Stackwise is a project focused on collecting, organizing, and combining high-value development patterns and best practices to enhance developer workflows with Large Language Models (like in Cursor), but it's not Cursor-specific.

## Workflow (Original)

- deno task import
- deno task chopper
- deno task eval
- deno task gen_index
- deno task gen_config
- deno task gen_templates
- deno task ai_compose
- deno task cli_compose

## Workflow (Markdown)

- deno task gen_index
- deno task gen_config
- deno task gen_templates
- deno task ai_compose
- deno task cli_compose



## Overview

Modern development involves complex interactions between design patterns, language-specific idioms, framework best practices, and architectural decisions. Stackwise aims to:

1. Collect established development patterns and practices
2. Organize these into meaningful, composable components
3. Enable developers to create custom combinations for their specific tech stacks
4. Facilitate better interactions with AI coding assistants

## Project Structure

The project organizes development knowledge into four main categories:

- **Principles**: Foundational design patterns and architectural concepts (e.g., SOLID, Gang of Four patterns)
- **Patterns**: Reusable solutions and implementation strategies
- **Elements**: Specific coding practices and conventions
- **Templates**: Framework and technology-specific implementations

## Use Cases

- Create customized rule sets for their development environment
- Combine best practices from multiple sources
- Generate consistent guidance for AI coding assistants
- Maintain standardized practices across projects
- Share and collaborate on development patterns

## Goals

- Create a standardized format for development patterns
- Enable easy composition of different practices
- Support multiple programming paradigms and frameworks
- Facilitate better human-AI collaboration in development
- Build a community-driven repository of best practices

## Current Status

- Defining standard formats for pattern documentation
- Creating parsers for existing rule sets
- Building tools for combining patterns
- Establishing validation methods

## Future Vision

Stackwise aims to become a comprehensive resource for:

- AI-assisted development practices
- Tech stack-specific pattern collections
- Development team collaboration
- Code quality and consistency
- Knowledge sharing and learning

## Contributing

We welcome contributions in the following areas:

- New pattern collections
- Framework-specific best practices
- Tool development for pattern management
- Documentation and examples
- Pattern validation and testing
