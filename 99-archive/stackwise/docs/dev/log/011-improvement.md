# Development Log: Primitive Improvement System

**Date:** January 10, 2025

## Architecture Decision

The Primitive Improvement System implements a focused approach to enhancing story framework primitives through targeted optimization passes. The system uses a multi-stage improvement process with dry-run capabilities and A/B testing preparation. This approach was chosen to ensure controlled, verifiable improvements while maintaining the integrity of the original primitives.

## Core Components

```ascii
src/
  ├── improve.ts        # Improvement engine
  ├── prep_ab.ts       # A/B test preparation
  └── templates/
      └── eval/
          └── improve-template.md   # Improvement prompt templates
```

## Implementation Details

The system operates through three main stages:

1. **Improvement Processing**
   - Multiple improvement focuses (simplification, modularity, flexibility)
   - Template-based improvement suggestions
   - Dry-run capability

2. **Result Management**
   - Separate improved versions
   - Original content preservation
   - Clean content extraction

3. **A/B Preparation**
   - Test candidate generation
   - Metadata preservation
   - Test manifest creation

## Core Functions

The system is built around these key functions:

- `improvePrompt()`: Processes content through LLM improvement
- `extractCleanContent()`: Separates metadata from improved content
- `prepareABTest()`: Generates test candidates

## Processing Pipeline

1. Improvement Process
   - Template selection
   - LLM processing
   - Result extraction

2. Content Management
   - Metadata preservation
   - Content cleaning
   - Result formatting

3. Test Preparation
   - Directory structure creation
   - Content organization
   - Manifest generation

## Technical Considerations

### Directory Structure

```
data/
  ├── primitives/       # Source primitives
  ├── improve/          # Improvement results
  └── candidates/       # A/B test candidates
      ├── a/           # Original versions
      └── b/           # Improved versions
```

### Content Extraction

Careful handling of content and metadata:

```typescript
function extractContent(fileContent: string): FileContent {
  const parts = fileContent.split('---\n').filter(Boolean);
  return {
    frontmatter: parts[0],
    content: parts.slice(1).join('---\n').trim()
  };
}
```

## Future Scope

Potential enhancements include:

1. **Enhanced Improvements**
   - Custom improvement strategies
   - Multi-pass improvements
   - Improvement validation

2. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Automated A/B testing
   - Performance metrics
   - Result analysis

## Benefits

1. **Controlled Improvement**
   - Dry-run capability
   - Focus-based improvements
   - Original content preservation

2. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Clean A/B test preparation
   - Manifest generation
   - Metadata preservation

3. **Flexibility**
   - Multiple improvement focuses
   - Easy to extend
   - Clean separation of concerns

## Conclusion

The Primitive Improvement System provides a robust framework for enhancing story primitives while maintaining careful control over the improvement process. Its structured approach to improvement and testing preparation ensures reliable and verifiable enhancements to the primitive library.

## Usage Guidelines

```bash
# Improvement Process
deno run --allow-read --allow-write --allow-env --allow-net src/improve.ts \
  --dir ./data/primitives/system/story/[framework] \
  --focus [improvement-type] \
  --dry-run

# A/B Test Preparation
deno run --allow-read --allow-write src/prep_ab.ts \
  --dir ./data/primitives/system/story/[framework]
```
