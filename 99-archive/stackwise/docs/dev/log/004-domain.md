# Development Log: Domain Architecture

**Date:** December 6, 2024

## Architecture Decision

Implemented a domain-based architecture to organize primitives across different fields of knowledge. Each domain represents a distinct field (like compute or yoga) with its own internal organization while maintaining consistent structural patterns.

## Core Organization

```ascii
primitives/
├── system/
│   ├── compute/
│   │   ├── clean-ode/
│   │   ├── core/
│   │   └── python/
│   └── wellness/
│       ├── yoga/
│       ├── swimming/
│       └── walking/
└── users/
    ├── paz/
    ├── tony/
    └── steph/
```

## Implementation Details

Domain Structure

- Top-level domains in primitives/ directory
- Each domain maintains its own logical subdirectory structure
- Consistent XML template format across all domains
- Domain-specific indexing with shared patterns

1. Index Organization
   - Domain-specific indexes for targeted access
   - Each index maintains consistent metadata structure

2. Template Consistency
   - XML templates share common structure across domains
   - Standardized meta section with category and tags
   - Domain-specific content while maintaining structural similarity
   - Enables cross-domain template processing

## Core Benefits

1. Clear Separation
   - Domains are logically isolated
   - Prevents mixing of unrelated concepts
   - Maintains focus within domain contexts

2. Scalable Structure
   - Easy addition of new domains
   - Consistent patterns for growth
   - Independent domain evolution

3. Unified Access
   - Common indexing patterns
   - Cross-domain discovery
   - Consistent API access patterns

## Interface Considerations

1. Index Structure
   - Domain field in primitive entries
   - Category and tags for cross-domain organization
   - Filepath reflects domain hierarchy
   - Enables domain-aware UI components

2. Template Processing
   - Domain-aware indexing
   - Consistent XML parsing across domains
   - Unified error handling

## Future Scope

1. Expansion Capabilities
   - New domains can be added without structural changes
   - Domain-specific validation rules
   - Custom processing per domain while maintaining common patterns

2. Cross-Domain Features
   - Inter-domain relationships
   - Cross-domain search capabilities
   - Composite templates spanning multiple domains

3. Potential Future Domains
   - Music (theory, practice, composition)
   - Art (techniques, theory, history)
   - Dance (forms, techniques, choreography)
   - Athletics (training, nutrition, recovery)

## Usage Guidelines

1. Domain Addition Process
   - Create new top-level domain directory
   - Establish domain-specific subdirectory structure
   - Implement domain templates following common patterns
   - Update indexer for domain-specific requirements

2. Template Organization
   - Maintain consistent XML structure
   - Use domain-appropriate categorization
   - Implement domain-specific validation where needed
   - Follow established naming conventions

3. Integration Points
   - Index generation maintains domain awareness
   - UI components can filter by domain
   - Cross-domain features respect domain boundaries

## Technical Considerations

1. Naming Conventions
   - Clear, contemporary domain names
   - Consistent subdirectory naming
   - Avoid conflicts with development terminology
   - Future-proof naming patterns

2. Processing Pipeline
   - Domain-aware template processing
   - Consistent error handling across domains
   - Scalable indexing strategies
   - Performance considerations for cross-domain operations
