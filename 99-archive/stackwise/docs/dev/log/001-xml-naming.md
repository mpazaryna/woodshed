# Development Log: XML Context Structure

**Date:** December 5, 2024

## Architecture Evolution

Started with basic XML templates. Clean. Direct. Each template held knowledge like a well-made box. But we needed more structure. Better organization.

## Core Changes

Added meta section for classification. Moved content under primitive node. Simple change. Big impact. Templates now have clear separation between metadata and core knowledge.

## Structure Details

Meta section carries tags, version, category. Like a good filing system. Each piece has its place. Primitive section holds the actual knowledge. Clean boundaries. Clear purpose.

## Template Examples

Converted DRY, KISS, YAGNI principles. Each one follows the pattern now. Development guidelines fit the same mold. Even project configs aligned cleanly. Structure breeds consistency.

## File Organization

Templates live in /primitives directory. Name tells the story. Single source of truth for each concept. Clean paths. Clear organization.

## Next Steps

Need more language-specific templates. Each one following the pattern. Validation to keep structure pure. Testing to prove correctness. Meta rules to guide the way.

This system will grow. But it will grow clean. Like a well-tended garden. Each new piece knowing its place. Structure maintaining order.
