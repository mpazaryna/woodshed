# Development Log: Stackwise Legacy Migration

**Date:** December 6, 2024

## Legacy Code Access

To access legacy codebase:
```bash
git checkout v1.5  # Replace with actual legacy tag
```

## Introduction

The codebase needed a clean break. A fresh start. The old code held value but couldn't mix with new. Orphan branch provided the path forward. Clean. Clear. No compromise.

## Migration Process

The separation came clean like breaking fresh bread. Created orphan branch. Removed old files. Brought in new ones. Force pushed to establish new truth. Old code sits safe behind tags, waiting if needed.

## Core Steps

Commands flowed like water over stone:
```bash
git checkout --orphan new-main
git rm -rf .
rm -rf *
```

New files came in clean. No history. No baggage:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit of new codebase"
git branch -D main
git branch -m main
git push -f origin main
```

## Implementation Notes

The orphan branch stood alone. Pure. Independent. Legacy tags mark the old path like cairns on a mountain trail. Each tells its story. Each holds its truth. Force push sealed the deal. New history began its journey.

## Migration Benefits

Benefits came clear as mountain air:
- Clean history start
- Legacy code preserved
- Clear separation of concerns
- Simplified future development
- Truth in versioning

## Next Steps

Path ahead runs straight and true. Documentation needs updating. CI/CD pipelines want checking. Team needs briefing on new structure. Each step as important as the last. No rushing. No shortcuts. Just clean, clear progress.
