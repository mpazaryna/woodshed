# Development Log: Index Generation Strategy

**Date:** December 5, 2024

## Architecture Decision

XML templates provide structure but need efficient access. Index generation bridges server-UI gap. Creates optimized data structure for frontend consumption.

## Core Benefits

Machine-generated index delivers pre-processed, normalized data. Eliminates client-side XML parsing. Reduces network payload. Frontend gets exactly what it needs.

## Performance Considerations

JSON format chosen for universal compatibility. Meta section provides version control and generation context. Flat structure optimizes frontend data access - O(1) lookup vs XML traversal.

## Implementation Details

Server-side processing handles heavy lifting. Index contains extracted, relevant fields only. No redundant data. Clean separation of concerns between storage format (XML) and consumption format (JSON).

## Optimization Strategy

- XML: Source of truth, optimized for content management
- JSON Index: Facade pattern, optimized for UI consumption
- Build-time processing eliminates runtime overhead
- Stateless design enables CDN caching

## Flexibility Points

System allows independent evolution of:

- Template structure (XML)
- UI consumption patterns (JSON)
- Build process (indexer)

Each layer can change without cascading impact.

## Future Scope

Consider watch mode for development. Explore incremental builds. Add schema validation. Infrastructure ready for scale.
