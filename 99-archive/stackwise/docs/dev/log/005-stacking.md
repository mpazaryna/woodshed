# Development Log: Stack Composition Architecture

**Date:** December 6, 2024

## Architecture Decision

The stack composition architecture represents a fundamental approach to creating dynamic development contexts through the systematic combination of primitive rules. This system employs a template-based methodology that separates the process into two distinct phases: composition selection and template stacking.

By implementing this architecture, we enable developers to construct custom development environments by selecting and combining specific rules and principles that align with their project requirements. The system's flexibility allows for both standardized rule sets and custom combinations while maintaining consistency through template-based composition.

## Core Components

```ascii
src/
  ├── compose.ts        # Template selection and composition root generation
  └── stack.ts          # Template loading and stacking implementation
```

The system's core functionality is divided between two primary components, each handling a distinct phase of the composition process. The compose.ts file manages the interactive selection and configuration of templates, while stack.ts handles the complex process of loading and combining these templates into a cohesive final structure.

These components work in concert to provide a seamless experience from initial template selection through to final composition, with each maintaining clear separation of concerns while sharing common interfaces and data structures.

## Implementation Details

The Template Builder, implemented in compose.ts, provides an interactive command-line interface that guides users through the template selection process. It manages project requirement gathering, framework detection, and clean code principle integration while ensuring that all required rules are properly included in the final composition.

The Template Loader, found in stack.ts, handles the complex task of processing and combining templates. It implements sophisticated template merging logic, circular dependency detection, and validation systems to ensure the integrity of the final composed template while maintaining efficient processing through template caching and selective validation.

## Core Functions

The promptUser function serves as the primary interface for template selection, guiding users through a series of questions to determine project requirements and preferences. It handles framework selection, clean code principle integration, and ensures all required rules are included, while maintaining a smooth and intuitive interaction flow.

The loadTemplate function forms the backbone of the template processing system, managing template loading, caching, and dependency resolution. It works in conjunction with processImports and mergeTemplates to handle the complex task of combining multiple templates while preserving their structural integrity and handling special cases like principle aggregation.

## Processing Pipeline

The composition phase begins with gathering user requirements through an interactive CLI, allowing developers to specify their project type, framework preferences, and desired clean code principles. This information is then used to generate a composition root that serves as the blueprint for the final template structure.

During the stacking phase, the system processes this composition root, resolving all template dependencies and merging the selected templates according to predefined rules. This phase handles the complex task of combining multiple templates while maintaining their structural integrity and resolving any conflicts that may arise.

## Interface Patterns

User interaction is primarily handled through a command-line interface that provides clear prompts and feedback during the template selection process. The interface guides users through project configuration while maintaining a balance between flexibility and structure, ensuring that all necessary information is collected while preventing invalid combinations.

Template structure follows a consistent XML-based format that allows for clear declaration of imports and rules while maintaining flexibility for different types of content. This standardized structure enables reliable processing while allowing for future extensions and modifications to the template system.

## Technical Considerations

Template processing incorporates several key optimizations and safeguards to ensure reliable operation. The system implements template caching to improve performance, circular dependency detection to prevent infinite loops, and comprehensive validation to ensure template integrity throughout the composition process.

Error handling has been carefully designed to provide meaningful feedback at each stage of the process. The system captures and reports errors with detailed context and stack traces, allowing developers to quickly identify and resolve issues while maintaining a robust recovery mechanism for common error conditions.

## Future Scope

The system architecture has been designed with future expansion in mind, allowing for the addition of new features such as graphical interfaces, template previews, and enhanced collaboration tools. These potential improvements can be integrated without fundamental changes to the core architecture.

Integration capabilities have been considered throughout the design, with clear interfaces that will allow for future integration with IDEs, CI/CD pipelines, and remote template repositories. This forward-thinking approach ensures that the system can evolve to meet future development needs while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Usage Guidelines

Template creation follows a straightforward pattern using XML structure, with clear conventions for naming and organization. Developers can create new templates by defining the necessary rules and dependencies while following established patterns for validation and principle organization.

The development workflow is designed to be intuitive and efficient, starting with template creation and moving through composition and stacking phases. Each phase has been optimized to provide clear feedback and validation while maintaining flexibility for different project requirements and team preferences.
