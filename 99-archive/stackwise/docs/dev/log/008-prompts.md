# Development Log: Domain-Aware Prompt Generation Strategy

**Date:** December 9, 2024

## Architecture Decision

We implemented a multi-stage system for generating and utilizing domain-specific prompts. The architecture deliberately separates prompt generation from prompt utilization, creating a flexible system that can handle multiple domains while maintaining strict context awareness. This separation allows for independent evolution of both the generation and utilization components while ensuring consistent behavior across different domains.

## Core Components

### Configuration Generation

Our system programmatically generates domain configurations through comprehensive analysis of primitive directories. This automated approach ensures consistency across domains, handles dynamic tag categorization, and manages language-specific rule detection. The configuration generator traverses the directory structure, identifying patterns and relationships between different components, ultimately creating a rich, structured representation of the domain's characteristics and rules.

### Domain Configuration Structure

The generated config.json serves as the backbone of our system, containing a carefully organized hierarchical structure. At its root, the configuration contains domain metadata and strategy definitions. This is followed by contextTypes, which define available languages and categories, and tagTypes, which separate generic and language-specific tags. The configuration also includes promptTemplate settings for dynamic generation and outputRules that govern tag selection and validation processes. This structure provides a complete representation of a domain's requirements and constraints.

### Prompt Generation

The system generates templates based on the domain configuration, creating structured formats optimized for LLM consumption. These templates contain detailed instructions for language detection, comprehensive listings of available tags, and explicit response format requirements. The generation process ensures that each domain has its own specialized prompt template that reflects its unique characteristics and requirements.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Configuration Building

The configuration building process begins with a thorough directory analysis. The system recursively scans primitive directories, extracting language contexts and identifying categories. During this process, we perform comprehensive tag classification, organizing and categorizing tags based on their usage patterns and relationships. This automated analysis ensures that our configuration accurately reflects the actual structure and content of our primitive files.

Tag organization follows, with the system automatically detecting and categorizing generic tags, mapping language-specific tags, establishing framework associations, and grouping categories. This organization process creates a clear hierarchy that reflects the relationships between different components of our system.

### Phase 2: Prompt Generation

Template creation forms the core of our prompt generation phase. The system generates domain-specific instruction sets that include comprehensive listings of available tags, detailed response format specifications, and contextual reminders. These templates are structured to maximize the effectiveness of our LLM interactions while maintaining consistency across different use cases.

Output organization ensures that generated prompts are stored in a logical, accessible manner. The system creates a hierarchical directory structure that segregates prompts by domain while maintaining consistent naming conventions. This organization makes it easy to locate and manage prompts for different domains and use cases.

### Phase 3: Integration

The runtime implementation brings together our configuration and prompts. The system dynamically loads prompts based on the current context, performs context-aware analysis, applies language-specific filtering, and validates tags against our defined rules. This integration phase ensures that all components work together seamlessly to provide accurate and relevant results.

## Advanced Features

Our language context awareness system provides sophisticated handling of programming languages and frameworks. The system automatically detects languages, recognizes frameworks, and applies appropriate filtering based on the detected context. This awareness extends to cross-language tag management, ensuring that tags are appropriately applied regardless of the specific language context.

Tag classification in our system goes beyond simple categorization. The system maintains clear distinctions between generic and specific tags, establishes language associations, manages framework relationships, and groups tags into meaningful categories. This sophisticated classification ensures that tags are applied appropriately and consistently across different contexts.

## Future Considerations

Our system design anticipates future needs through several planned enhancements. We're considering implementing a watch mode for development, allowing for immediate updates as primitive files change. We're also exploring incremental configuration updates and enhanced schema validation to improve system reliability and performance.

Template evolution represents another area for future development. We're planning to implement version control for prompts, template inheritance capabilities, and enhanced domain-specific customization options. These improvements will make our system more flexible and easier to maintain as requirements evolve.

Analysis improvements are also on our roadmap. We're exploring response caching mechanisms, batch processing capabilities, and various performance optimizations. These enhancements will help our system scale effectively as usage grows.

## Documentation Importance

Given the complexity of our system, maintaining comprehensive documentation is crucial. We need to regularly update our documentation to reflect changes in configuration structure, generation processes, template formats, and integration points. This documentation serves as both a reference for current developers and an onboarding tool for new team members. Regular updates ensure that our documentation remains aligned with the current state of the system and continues to serve its purpose effectively.
