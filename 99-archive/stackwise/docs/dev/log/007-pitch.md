# Stackwise Development Log

## Primary Pitch

Stackwise brings engineering wisdom to the AI era through intelligent composition of proven primitives. Starting in the rapidly growing developer tools market, we let teams build rich, consistent contexts by stacking fundamental patterns and best practices - solving a critical challenge as organizations struggle to maintain quality context across teams using AI coding assistants. Our library of composable elements ensures that everyone, from experienced developers to the growing wave of AI-assisted programmers, works within well-structured, consistent contexts that embody engineering best practices. We've validated this approach in the development space, but our patent-pending composition engine is designed to extend into any domain where expertise needs to be structured for AI interaction - from legal to healthcare to finance.

## Market & Funding Position

We've developed and tested our core engine with early adopters in the developer community, seeing strong validation of both our technical approach and market need. Our XML-based primitive system is production-ready, and we're seeking seed funding to accelerate our go-to-market strategy. The timing is critical - as companies invest heavily in AI development tools, they're discovering the need for consistent, high-quality contexts to guide AI interactions across teams. We're positioned to be the essential bridge between domain expertise and AI-assisted workflows, ensuring quality and consistency at scale.

## Technical Validation

- [ ] Document current primitive types (rules, templates, opinions)
- [ ] Create comprehensive examples for each primitive type
- [ ] Test primitive composition in various scenarios
- [ ] Benchmark performance with different stack sizes
- [ ] Document XML schema and validation rules
- [ ] Create integration tests for common use cases

## Market Validation

- [ ] Identify 3-5 early adopter developers/teams
- [ ] Document specific pain points solved

## Key Questions to Explore

### Technical

1. How do we ensure primitives compose reliably?
2. What validation is needed for user-created primitives?
3. How do we handle versioning and updates?
4. What metrics should we track for primitive effectiveness?

### Market

1. What are the key adoption barriers?
2. Which development teams would benefit most?
3. How do we position against existing tools?
4. What pricing model makes sense for different users?

### Domain Expansion

1. What criteria for selecting next domains?
2. How to validate domain-specific primitives?
3. What adaptations needed for non-dev domains?
4. How to maintain quality across domains?

## Next Steps

1. Validate core engine with additional test cases
2. Document current primitive library
3. Begin early adopter outreach
4. Prepare detailed financial projections
5. Create prototype of primitive marketplace
