# Development Log: Forge Architecture

**Date:** December 6, 2024

## Architecture Decision

Implemented a three-stage pipeline for context refinement: import -> forge -> primitives. Forge serves as the critical middle layer where raw content is refined into well-structured primitives for AI consumption.

## Core Benefits

Single workspace design simplifies workflow. Clear separation between raw imports and production-ready primitives. Forge provides dedicated space for iterative refinement without constraining the process to fixed substages.

## Process Considerations

Forge acts as a true workspace rather than a pass-through layer. Content remains in forge until fully refined. Graduation to primitives indicates production readiness. No intermediate states needed - keeps cognitive load low.

## Implementation Details

Clean linear flow:

- Import: Raw content ingestion
- Forge: Unrestricted refinement workspace
- Primitives: Production-ready components

## Optimization Strategy

- Single workspace eliminates decision overhead
- Clear status indication (location = state)
- Supports arbitrary refinement steps
- Reduces filesystem complexity

## Flexibility Points

System allows independent evolution of:

- Import patterns
- Refinement processes
- Primitive structures
- Domain-specific requirements

## Future Scope

Consider metadata for tracking refinement progress. Explore automation opportunities. Add validation gates for primitive graduation. Infrastructure supports expansion to new domains like art and music.
