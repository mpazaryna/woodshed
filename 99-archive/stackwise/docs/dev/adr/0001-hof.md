# ADR 0001: Implement Higher-Order Functions for Cross-Cutting Concerns

Date: 2024-11-13

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Our application needs to handle multiple cross-cutting concerns (rate limiting, error handling, performance monitoring) across different rule implementations. We need an architectural pattern that:

- Maintains separation of concerns
- Keeps core business logic pure and focused
- Allows for easy addition/removal of cross-cutting functionality
- Provides type safety and maintainability
- Supports composition of multiple concerns

The current implementation mixes these concerns with business logic, making the code harder to maintain and test.

## Decision

We will implement a Higher-Order Function (HOF) architecture where:

1. Base rule functions contain only core business logic
2. Cross-cutting concerns are implemented as HOF wrappers
3. Final enhanced functions are composed using these wrappers

Example structure:

```typescript
const withRateLimit = <T, Args extends any[]>(
  fn: (...args: Args) => Promise<T>,
  config: RateLimitConfig
) => async (...args: Args): Promise<T> => {
  // Rate limiting logic
  return fn(...args);
};

// Usage
const rateLimitedFunction = withRateLimit(baseFunction, {
  maxRequestsPerMinute: 5,
  requestWindow: 60000
});
```

This pattern allows us to:

- Add/remove concerns without modifying base functions
- Compose multiple wrappers in a clear order
- Maintain type safety through TypeScript generics
- Test concerns independently

## Consequences

### Positive

1. Improved separation of concerns
   - Core logic remains pure
   - Cross-cutting concerns are isolated
   - Easier to test individual components

2. Enhanced maintainability
   - Clear function composition chain
   - Easy to add/remove functionality
   - Consistent pattern across codebase

3. Better type safety
   - Generic type parameters ensure type safety
   - TypeScript compiler enforces correct usage

### Negative

1. Increased complexity
   - Stack traces become more complex
   - Learning curve for new developers
   - More complex type definitions

2. Performance considerations
   - Each wrapper adds function call overhead
   - Need to monitor and optimize hot paths

### Mitigations

1. For complexity:
   - Maintain clear documentation
   - Keep wrapper chain depth reasonable
   - Use meaningful function names

2. For performance:
   - Profile and optimize critical paths
   - Use only necessary wrappers
   - Monitor performance metrics

## Implementation Notes

### Required Changes

1. Create base HOF wrappers for:
   - Rate limiting
   - Error handling
   - Performance monitoring

2. Update existing rule implementations to use HOF pattern

3. Add monitoring and metrics collection

### Best Practices

1. Wrapper Design
   - Single responsibility per wrapper
   - Consistent naming conventions
   - Clear documentation

2. Error Handling
   - Preserve error context
   - Use appropriate error types
   - Maintain error chain

3. Testing
   - Test wrappers independently
   - Verify composed functions
   - Cover error cases

## Related Decisions

- Need to decide on metrics collection strategy
- May need to establish wrapper ordering conventions
- Consider standardizing configuration patterns
