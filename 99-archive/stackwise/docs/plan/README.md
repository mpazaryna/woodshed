# Planning Directory

## Purpose

This directory tracks development initiatives and feature requests before they become formal GitHub issues. It serves as a staging area to refine and document ideas that emerged from team discussions, particularly focusing on updates from Tony's development work during the London trip (November 2024).

## Structure

- Individual `.md` files for each planned feature or enhancement
- `STATUS.md` tracking the progress of each item's journey to becoming a GitHub issue

## Current Focus Areas

1. **Rule Import System** - Streamlining the process of importing and preparing rules
2. **CLI Command System** - New multiple-choice approach for user interaction
3. **Template System** - Enhancing variable support and fixing formatting issues
4. **Stackwise Demo** - Improving core functionality for demonstrations
5. **Shortcode Implementation** - Adding chat-based function support

## Process

1. New ideas and features are documented in individual markdown files
2. Requirements and details are refined through team discussion
3. Once fully specified, items are converted to GitHub issues
4. Status is tracked in `STATUS.md`

## Related Documentation

- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in `/dev/adr`
- Developer logs in `/dev/logs`
- Additional context in Tony's Notion documentation

## Notes

This planning directory was created to organize development initiatives discussed during November 2024, with a focus on maintaining clear documentation of feature requests and enhancements before they become formal tickets.
