      "When it comes to event marketing content, social media is one of the most valuable approaches out there. Not only does it let you instantly reach and connect with your audience, but it offers a range of different platforms on which to do so and plenty of different formats to share information about your event.\n",
      "The multitude of social media marketing possibilities can, however, make it an overwhelming route to go down if you don’t have a clear strategy in mind. If you’re looking for direction on how to promote events on social media, this article shares advice on choosing the best social media channel, promoting an event on social media and gaining social media coverage during the event.\n",
      "In this article:\n",
      "How to Choose the Right Channels and Social Networks\n",
      "How to Promote an Event on Social Media\n",
      "Gaining Social Media Coverage During an Event\n",
      "Summary\n",
      "How to Choose the Right Channels and Social Networks\n",
      "One of the first things you need to consider when creating a social media strategy for events is which channels you’re going to use to share your marketing content. There are several very popular platforms to choose from, each tailored towards a slightly different kind of content and type of audience.\n",
      "Facebook\n",
      "Facebook is one of the best-known and most popular social media platforms, initially used as a space to keep in contact with friends and now also an incredibly valuable platform for businesses to promote their offerings and interact with their audience.\n",
      "In terms of event promotion, you can create a Facebook event page for your event to start advertising it and sharing information with those that respond to the invitation. Depending on the scale of the event, you can use this as the main organisational hub of your event, or simply share it on your company’s Facebook page to drum up more interest.\n",
      "You can share text and image content on Facebook, so it’s quite a versatile platform for marketing. Certain demographics are much more active on other platforms however, so be sure to research how much your target audience actually uses Facebook and adapt your marketing strategy accordingly.\n",
      "Instagram\n",
      "Instagram is an image-sharing social media app that more recently has become a hub for video content as well. It’s a great place for sharing visual marketing content as part of your event promotion strategy. Not only can you post on to your company’s profile, but you can also share ‘Stories’ that only last 24 hours and ‘Reels’ which are short videos also posted to your account.\n",
      "A lot of younger demographics use Instagram as one of their main social media platforms, so if your event is targeting a millennial or even Gen-Z audience then it’s a great place to focus your efforts. Regular posting and high engagement is the key to ensuring that your Instagram posts actually get seen by your followers however, so you’ll need to establish a posting strategy if you want to make an impact.\n",
      "Twitter\n",
      "Twitter is a social media platform where users can share short text posts, or ‘Tweets’ with their followers, along with images or video clips. It’s a great channel for posting quick updates and information about an event, as well as being a brilliant place to interact with your followers and respond to questions or mentions in real-time.\n",
      "You should focus on text content if you want to include Twitter in your event social media marketing plan, ensuring that you can condense this information under 280 characters. It’s a great platform for using and monitoring hashtags as well, which we’ll delve into later in this article.\n",
      "LinkedIn\n",
      "LinkedIn is a social media platform that was designed for professional networking, but can be a fantastic place to promote your event if you have a large network of followers. Like Facebook, you can also create an event page for your event on LinkedIn and then share this with your network, helping your gauge interest and keep all the event details in one place.\n",
      "If your event has a professional focus then LinkedIn is definitely a channel you should involve in your social media strategy, even more so if you’re hosting speakers that have their own significant followings on this network. The more people you can get talking about your event or sharing your marketing content on LinkedIn, the better.\n",
      "Snapchat\n",
      "You might be surprised to see Snapchat on this list, as this social media channel is primarily used for messaging. However, Snapchat ‘stories’ can be useful for some event organisers as they create a way to compile all of the content shared by users/attendees in one place, and also share their own visual content in a more personal way.\n",
      "Snapchat filters are another feature that you might want to consider for your event, creating a personalised image filter promoting the event that attendees can use and then share with their friends on the app.\n",
      "TikTok\n",
      "Finally, TikTok is considered a bit of a new kid on the block when it comes to social media platforms and is currently creating a huge amount of buzz with its short video-sharing format and potential for content to quickly go viral. This is another channel that is favoured by younger demographics in particular, but there’s a lot of potential for event planners to use the app to share promotional video content for the event and reach a new audience through the app.\n",
      "How to Promote an Event on Social Media\n",
      "Once you’ve chosen which social media channels you’re going to focus on in your event marketing strategy, there are plenty of different ways that you can share content to promote the event. As well as classic posts sharing event information, here are some other approaches that we recommend including in your plan.\n",
      "Post ‘Countdown’ Reminders\n",
      "If you want to build excitement around your event and also keep engagement from your audience high in the lead-up, posting regular ‘countdown’ reminders is a great tactic on social media. You might start with monthly or weekly reminders, and then in the final week start posting a daily countdown that shares a taster of what’s to come and keep the event at the front of attendees’ minds.\n",
      "Some social media apps like Instagram also give you the option to post a countdown sticker that your followers can interact with, sending them a notification as a reminder that the event is coming up or starting.\n",
      "Slowly Reveal the Lineup\n",
      "On the topic of anticipation and building excitement, another great event social media marketing tactic is slowly revealing your event itinerary or lineup, if relevant. Structure these posts so that you’re sharing a good range of different speakers or events within the wider event, and even consider getting your audience to guess what the next reveal might be if you want to boost engagement even more.\n",
      "You don’t just have to reveal your lineup or itinerary through a classic social media post. You could start a live stream to share this information, or get another account to announce their attendance first and then share this content on your own platform as a reveal.\n",
      "Boost Engagement with Polls\n",
      "Engagement is key in a social media strategy before an event takes place, and polls are a great way to encourage this from your followers. Quite a few apps have a poll feature that followers can interact with which also allow the user to then share the results, giving you more content to repost and also a way to gather attendee feedback.\n",
      "You can also post polls during your event as a way of recapping what’s happening and getting a feel for how the event is going. This also shows your social media followers that aren’t attending what is happening and hopefully encourages them to attend the next event you organise.\n",
      "Repost Content from Attendees and Speakers\n",
      "This is an event promotion technique that you can use to share content on social media both before, after and during your event. Sharing or reposting content about your event from attendees not only gives you a wider range of content to share, but also shows a more authentic side to your event by illustrating it from a different perspective.\n",
      "Reposting content from your attendees also makes them feel more connected to your event and brand because you’re engaging with what they post.\n",
      "Show What’s Happening Behind the Scenes\n",
      "Authentic social media content is often more memorable and can gain more engagement because it gives your followers something they can relate to more easily. Creating behind-the-scenes content is a fantastic event social media approach that adds something different to your usual posts and is particularly useful if you’re using platforms that have a live stream feature.\n",
      "You can also take photos of behind-the-scenes moments and share these after the event as an alternative round-up. It might even be worth giving a guest or a speaker control of your social media profile for a period of time to show a more personal behind-the-scenes experience.\n",
      "Stay updated with the latest MICE insights!\n",

      "Access Now \n",
      "Gaining Social Media Coverage During an Event\n",
      "As well as thinking about what social media content you’re going to share around your event, you also need to think about how you’ll encourage attendees to share content as well and provide you with social media coverage.\n",
      "Using Hashtags\n",
      "Hashtags are a classic social media marketing tool that involves creating a unique hashtag that you use on your posts and encourage attendees to use in the content they share about your event. You can view all of the content tagged with this hashtag in one place on apps like Twitter and Instagram, giving you a straightforward way to find out what people are saying about the event and choose which content you want to share.\n",
      "If you want to make use of a social media hashtag for your event, make sure to include it on all of your promotional material and use it around the venue so that attendees know how to get involved.\n",
      "QR Codes\n",
      "Another way to encourage attendees to interact with your profile and social media content is to include QR codes around the venue and on leaflets, posters or even stickers that take them directly to the event’s page or your social media account. Use snappy calls to action to encourage this and track how much the code has been used to measure your success.\n",
      "Live Streaming \n",
      "We’ve already mentioned live streaming as something that you can do to share live content at your event, but you can also encourage attendees to share their experiences with their followers in real time. This might just be documenting their day, or you could arrange that certain speakers go live on social media during the event to get their followers involved and spread awareness of the event.\n",
      "Event Geofilters\n",
      "Finally, some social media platforms like Snapchat let you create geofilters that are only accessible when in an event venue, and offer a fun image filter that promotes the event. This can be an expensive investment, but if you’re planning a large-scale event then it’s a great way to get your event branding included in attendees' content.\n",
      "Summary\n",
      "There is a huge range of options when it comes to how you can use social media in an event marketing strategy, allowing brands to pick and choose the approaches that they think will be best for their team and their audience. The key is to focus your efforts on specific platforms instead of trying to spread yourself too thinly, and also make the most of all the different features that these platforms offer so that your content is as diverse as possible.\n",

      " To increase awareness of your events and boost ticket sales, businesses should consider investing their time and effort into social media event promotion and marketing. Planning ahead and developing a cohesive marketing strategy can unlock social media’s full marketing potential.\n",
      "While most of your social media marketing and event promotion occurs before an event starts, it shouldn’t stop there. Promoting your event on social media while it’s happening and even after it’s over is just as important as creating initial hype.\n",
      "When you think about connecting with your followers at every possible touchpoint, including social media marketing, you’re more likely to convert them into customers. With that in mind, here are some easy tips to incorporate into your social media event promotion strategy before, during, and after your next event.\n",
      "Choosing the Right Social Media Platforms for Event Promotion\n",
      "Choosing the right social media platforms for event promotion is crucial to reaching your target audience effectively. Each social media platform caters to different demographics and has unique features that can enhance your event marketing strategy. Here’s an overview of some popular social media platforms and their potential benefits for promoting events:\n",
      "Facebook\n",
      "With over 2.8 billion monthly active users, Facebook is a versatile platform suitable for various types of events. It offers event creation features, allowing you to create dedicated pages, share event details, and engage with attendees.\n",
      "Benefits: Extensive reach, event analytics, and the ability to create a community around your event.\n",
      "Instagram\n",
      "Known for its visually appealing content, Instagram is perfect for events that can be showcased through images and short videos. The platform’s Stories and IGTV features are valuable for sharing behind-the-scenes content and event highlights.\n",
      "Benefits: Visual engagement, hashtag usage for event discoverability, and influencer partnerships.\n",
      "Twitter\n",
      "Twitter is a real-time platform that excels in quick updates and conversations. It’s suitable for events where frequent updates, live-tweeting, and audience engagement are essential.\n",
      "Benefits: Hashtag trends, real-time updates, and direct interaction with attendees and influencers.\n",
      "LinkedIn\n",
      "Ideal for professional and B2B events, LinkedIn allows you to target a more business-oriented audience. It’s effective for sharing detailed event information, industry insights, and networking opportunities.\n",
      "Benefits: Professional networking, targeted advertising, and thought leadership.\n",
      "YouTube\n",
      "For events with rich visual content or video highlights, YouTube provides a platform for sharing longer videos and live streaming. It’s suitable for conferences, performances, and product launches.\n",
      "Benefits: Video content, live streaming, and a dedicated channel for event archives.\n",
      "Snapchat \n",
      "Primarily used by a younger demographic, Snapchat is perfect for creating ephemeral content that encourages FOMO (fear of missing out). It’s great for events with a sense of urgency and exclusivity.\n",
      "Benefits: FOMO marketing, geofilters, and interactive content.\n",
      "When choosing the right social media platforms, consider your target audience, the nature of your event, and the type of content you plan to share. A well-rounded approach that combines multiple platforms strategically can maximize your event promotion efforts.\n",
      "TikTok \n",
      "TikTok has rapidly gained popularity for its short-form video content. With a focus on creativity and trends, TikTok is suitable for events that can leverage engaging and entertaining video content.\n",
      "Benefits: Influencer collaborations, hashtag challenges, live streams.\n",
      "Social Media Event Promotion Strategies to Promote Your Event Before It Happens\n",
      "1. Share behind-the-scenes details\n",
      "Build hype around an upcoming event by showing a little of what’s going on behind the scenes. You can “tease” the event by introducing your followers to important guests, such as hosts or panelists, and sharing photos and videos of the event venue, program, or agenda.\n",
      "The goal here is to give potential event attendees just enough information to entice them and encourage them to register for your event without spoiling the entire experience.\n",
      "2. Come up with an event hashtag\n",
      "Creating a branded event hashtag will help you organize all event-related content across your social media channels. \n",
      "Make it unique, short, and easy to spell so it’s recognizable and easy for attendees to use. \n",
      "To ensure that people see and engage with the hashtag, use it on all event-related social media content and marketing materials. You can even email attendees ahead of time, encouraging them to use the hashtag themselves on their social media pages when they talk about the event.\n",
      "Utilizing an event hashtag curates a collection of user-generated content that you can re-share to your audience to show the event from an attendee’s point of view. Sharing user-generated content excites attendees about posting more in hopes that their posts get picked next. \n",
      "3. Countdown to the event\n",
      "Create a countdown to get your social media followers excited about your upcoming event.\n",
      "Instagram makes this easy with its countdown sticker feature on Instagram Stories. Simply set an end date and time, and you’re ready! \n",
      "To customize your countdown further, edit its name and color to reflect your event’s branding. In their article about marketing ideas, Getting Attention explains that cohesiveness among your marketing materials is key to brand recognition.\n",
      "When people view your countdown, they can subscribe to receive a notification when the countdown is over and share the countdown on their own Instagram Story.\n",
      "While you can certainly use this feature to remind your followers of the event, it’s potentially even more useful for calling attention to ticket sale deadlines to drive sales.\n",
      "4. Make a Facebook event page\n",
      "Facebook event pages are an incredible way to store and share information about your event in one place. You can add the date, time, event category, description, and photos to really flesh out the page.\n",
      "Additionally, take advantage of the event page’s discussion area to post updates and answer any questions before the event. You can also tag hosts or panelists so they can share the information as well.\n",
      "Most importantly, don’t forget to add the ticketing link to your event page for easy access.\n",
      "A wonderful feature of Facebook Event Pages is when someone interacts with your event pages and identifies as ‘Going’ or “interested’ Facebook then shares that information and your page with their audience, exposing your events page to a much wider audience than you have on your own individual page.  \n",
      "5. Host a contest or giveaway\n",
      "To increase brand awareness before an event, try hosting a social media contest or giveaway.\n",
      "First, create a post with the details of the giveaway. Then, ask your followers to share the post using your event hashtag to enter.\n",
      "For the price of some free tickets or merchandise, you can exponentially expand your reach and encourage ticket sales, making this strategy worth the investment.\n",
      "Social Media Event Promotion Strategies to Promote Your Event While It Happens\n",
      "6. Engage with your followers in real-time\n",
      "There are many different ways you can spark conversations online about your event. Live tweet important updates or information that your followers could benefit from. This play-by-play coverage style helps your followers feel immersed in the event even if they’re not actually there.\n",
      "You could also take advantage of Instagram Stories by interviewing hosts and attendees or sharing pictures and videos of the event in action. Remember to use your event hashtag to keep all your event content in one place.\n",
      "7. Display social media posts at the event\n",
      "Just as you can incorporate your event into your social media posts, you can also incorporate social media into the event itself. Display tweets or comments about your event on a large screen to initiate a dialogue between your followers and attendees.\n",
      "You can also answer questions that pop up, making the conversation more interactive between the in-person and online participants.\n",
      "Social Media Event Promotion Strategies to Promote Your Event After It Happens\n",
      "8. Post-related user-generated content\n",
      "User-generated content is an incredible addition to your social media channels because it’s organic and shows your event from different perspectives.\n",
      "After your event, go to your event hashtag and take a look at the content people have created. 43% of regular TikTok users feel that the promotional content they see on the app blends in with other content, so TikTok is a great platform for finding organic, engaging, user-generated content.\n",
      "Then, respond to the creators to show you value their engagement with the event. TikTok users appreciate when businesses comment on user-generated content, with 77% agreeing that they love to see brands get excited about what other people post. Just make sure you get the creators’ permission before sharing their content. \n",
      "9. Solicit feedback.\n",
      "Finding out what people liked and disliked about your event is the best way to make future improvements. Start by thanking people for attending your event. eCardWidget recommends thanking supporters promptly and personally to make them feel appreciated. \n",
      "Add details to your thank you notes, such as attendees’ names, the specific event they attended, and any details about their participation, such as if they made user-generated content or purchased during the event.\n",
      "Next, ask your attendees if they have any feedback they’d like to share. You can do this through a social media comment, a direct message, an email, or a formal survey. Then, analyze the data you receive and incorporate it into your next event’s marketing strategy.\n",
      "10. Summarize the event for those who couldn’t make it.\n",
      "Provide some quick summaries on your social media channels to let people in on the event who couldn’t attend. These should include your best highlights or snippets of the event, such as photos, videos, and notable quotes or information.\n",
      "You can also send a recap email summarizing the event for attendees and email list subscribers. That way, attendees remember the main details, and subscribers can get excited about possibly attending the next event.\n",
      "Frequently Asked Questions About Social Media Event Promotion\n",
      "What are the advantages of using social media for event promotion?\n",
