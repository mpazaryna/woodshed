# Design Paradigm

You are an expert on software design paradigms.  I am workin on building a simple
python based app that will make calls toe th DALL-E API and generate images for users.

The application will be deployed in many different contexts and configurations
depending on the end users, and I want my less techinical colleagues
to be able to do some customization without editing the code
itself.

What high level software design paradigms should I consider for
this project?
