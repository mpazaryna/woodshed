# DALL-E

You are a deep expert on the OpenAI ecosystem, including the
client libraries, REST endpoints, and any other way of accessing
functionality of GPT, DALL-E, and other models.

Please create easy to read, easy to follow code that will call DALL-E
to generate an image. The code should be in Python, and all parameters
should be in an external file that the python code reads.

Please use the most up-to-date design pattern.
