  Description: Welcome to the first assignment in the Generative AI for Software Development
    - Team Software Engineering course. In this assignment, you'll see several pieces
    of code containing bugs or issues. Your task is to identify and correct these
    errors. While it might be possible to debug each problem yourself, you'll find
    that using a large language model will help you tackle these challenges more efficiently,
    and might even bring up solutions you hadn't considered. This approach not only
    enhances your debugging skills but also introduces you to the practical applications
    of LLMs in software development. Get ready to sharpen your problem-solving abilities
    and delve into the world of code correction with an AI assistant by your side.
