    "# Programming Assignment: Social Network Database Fix\n",
    "\n",
    "## Welcome!\n",
    "\n",
    "You've reached a practical part of our course, **Generative AI for Software Development - AI-Powered Software and System Design**. This task is all about diving into a database designed for managing a social network. It's a hands-on challenge to test your skills and see how well you can work with AI tools, like a Language Learning Model (LLM).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Mission\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to use an LLM to understand the code for creating a database and query over it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Write Three Functions:** Use the LLM to help you craft three functions. They should:\n",
    "   - List all members of a specific club.\n",
    "   - List all friends of a specific person.\n",
    "   - List all people who consider a specific person their friend.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with the LLM:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ask the LLM for Help:** Use the LLM to guide you through fixing the database and creating your functions.\n",
    "- **Use Its Advice Wisely:** Remember, the LLM's advice might not always be spot-on. It's up to you to decide what's useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What to Submit:\n",
    "\n",
    "Please submit this Jupyter notebook containing:\n",
    "- The three functions you've written.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How We'll Grade It:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functionality of Your Functions:** We'll see if each of your functions is doing exactly what it's supposed to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips for Success:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Be Clear with Your Questions:** The clearer your questions to the LLM, the better help you'll get.\n",
    "- **Test the Advice:** Always test out the LLMâ€™s suggestions to ensure they work as expected.\n",
    "- **Hints**: If you struggle with this assignment, you can check some hints we left to you in the bottom of the assignment!"
