# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:

The strategy pattern enables interchangeable algorithms for grading companies, enhancing code flexibility and improving software quality through design patterns.

# MAIN POINTS:

1. Strategy pattern creates a family of interchangeable algorithms for flexible use.
2. Useful for implementing different grading strategies for companies.
3. Requires defining a strategy interface and concrete strategies.
4. GradingStrategies class has an abstract method assign_grade for implementation.
5. Bollinger Band grading strategy uses simple logic for grading.
6. Threshold grading strategy uses numeric thresholds for grading.
7. Strategies can be easily swapped in code by passing the desired strategy.
8. Strategy pattern provides a flexible way to switch grading approaches.
9. Enhances code quality by using design patterns and LLMs for analysis.
10. Aids in building better software with available tools and design patterns.

# TAKEAWAYS:

1. Strategy pattern allows easy swapping of algorithms without altering client code.
2. Abstract base classes facilitate creating interchangeable algorithm strategies.
3. Strategy pattern enhances flexibility and adaptability in code implementation.
4. Design patterns and LLMs improve code quality and software development.
5. Using the right tools and patterns is essential for efficient software building.
