## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:

Using an LLM like ChatGPT can enhance coding efficiency by suggesting and implementing design patterns to improve software engineering practices.

## MAIN POINTS:

1. Singleton pattern manages data access in a mobile app by ensuring a single database connection.
2. Discovery of the singleton pattern involved extensive research and community discussions.
3. LLMs like ChatGPT provide an efficient way to analyze code and suggest design improvements.
4. Example application simulates financial services with a database of stock price data.
5. Prompts guide LLMs to create synthetic data and perform statistical calculations like moving averages.
6. LLMs can refactor code using design patterns, improving code efficiency and structure.
7. Singleton pattern prevents multiple database connections, conserving memory and bandwidth.
8. Factory method, template method, and strategy patterns are recommended for object creation and algorithm structuring.
9. Risk of code errors increases with sweeping changes; incremental updates are preferable.
10. LLMs offer explanations and step-by-step guidance for implementing design patterns.

## TAKEAWAYS:

1. LLMs can assist in identifying and applying design patterns to improve software design.
2. Incremental code updates with LLMs minimize the risk of introducing errors.
3. Singleton pattern is crucial for efficient database connection management.
4. Factory method pattern aids in creating objects suitable to specific situations.
5. LLMs can synthesize data and automate complex calculations, saving development time.
