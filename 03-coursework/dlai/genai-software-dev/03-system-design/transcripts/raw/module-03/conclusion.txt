Congratulations on
completing this course. Over the past three modules, you've gained valuable skills to enhance your
coding capabilities, and you learned how to
work with an LLM like ChatGPT as your reliable
pair programmer. In the first module, you saw how an LLM can help
you think through data serialization
and its role in a software design paradigm called configuration-driven
development. You saw how JSON
files can be used to externalize the
configuration of an app so that settings that
might change are separated from the core
logic of the app itself. You also saw how you could
use something like pickle to serialize complex objects or
preserve application states. You leveraged ChatGPT's
deep knowledge of these concepts to implement a prototype configurable app that generates
images using DALL-E. The second module took you
into the world of databases. You discovered how to design robust and efficient databases using ChatGPT to design a schema and implement
CRUD operations. Using an LLM as a database expert gives
you a powerful tool to build and manage databases that are both scalable
and maintainable. GPT's ability to offer real-time insights and
suggestions help you navigate complex
database challenges making you a more proficient
database developer. While the example you worked on use SQLAlchemy and Python, the prompting skills
you learned will apply to other implementations
like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or indeed any other
database management system. In the final module, you looked into the realm
of design patterns, focusing on those from
the Gang of Four. You worked with an
LLM to build out a financial services
application, and you applied patterns like Singleton Factory and
template methods to improve the app design and
solve real-world problems. GPT was there to guide
you through each step, providing examples
and clarifications to solidify your understanding. You now have a strong
foundation in using an LLM to think through design patterns
and to create flexible, reusable, and maintainable code. As you move forward in
your coding journey, remember that the
skills and knowledge you've gained here are
just the beginning. LLMs, like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini, will continue to be
powerful allies, helping you tackle new challenges
and refine your craft. But I will encourage
you to remember this. Don't let the LLM
dictate your code. I'm seeing increasing sentiment about junior developers taking code from an LLM and just using it without
fully understanding it. The more senior developers
then have to take on the technical debt of fixing the bugs and issues that arise. Remember, someday you might be that more senior developer. When we see lots of
code generated for us, it's tempting to use it
and then just move on to the next problem.
But please don't. It's sacrificing the future
to save the present. Instead, keep experimenting,
keep learning, and most importantly,
keep coding. Your future as a proficient and efficient developer
looks bright. Thank you for being a part of this course, and happy coding.
