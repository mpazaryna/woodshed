# You got deno in my python project

From a senior developer perspective, I would generally advise against mixing Deno/TypeScript into a primarily Python project for this use case. Here's my reasoning:

1. **Maintenance Burden**:

   - Adding Deno introduces a second runtime environment that needs to be installed and maintained
   - Team members would need to be familiar with both Python and TypeScript/Deno
   - Additional setup steps in CI/CD pipelines
   - More complex documentation requirements

2. **Ecosystem Consistency**:

   - The original script works with Python's ecosystem, which is likely already established in the project
   - Other tools and scripts are probably in Python
   - Team likely has existing Python testing, linting, and code quality tools set up

3. **Limited Benefits**:

   - The Deno version doesn't provide significant advantages over the Python version
   - The script is relatively simple and works well in Python
   - No compelling technical reason (like specific TypeScript libraries needed) to justify the switch

4. **Best Practice Violation**:
   - Mixing language runtimes for similar tasks goes against the principle of keeping the tech stack simple and consistent
   - Makes the repository more complex to clone and get running
   - Could confuse new team members about which language to use for new scripts

Unless there's a specific requirement that absolutely necessitates using Deno (which seems unlikely for this use case), I would recommend:

1. Stick with the Python version
2. If improvements are needed, enhance the Python code instead
3. Focus on making the Python version more robust (e.g., adding tests, improving error handling, etc.)

Remember: "Simple is better than complex" from the Zen of Python applies not just to code but to the entire project structure.
