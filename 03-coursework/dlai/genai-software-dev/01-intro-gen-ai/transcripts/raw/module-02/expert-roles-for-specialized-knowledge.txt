Using roles has helped you optimize the
responses of the LLM, and let's take this
to the next level by instructing GPT to be more
than just a code generator. It should act as a key member
of your developer team, offering insights based on the vast data that
it's been trained on and bringing an experienced programmer's
perspective to its responses. Our first example
instructs the model to carry out a Python
library critique. You'll use a sample
library designed for data visualization and prompt ChatGPT to evaluate
it critically, suggesting improvements
to make it comparable with
industry standards. Let's start with this code then we'll prompt the
model to adopt the role of a contributor to open source
software projects and instruct it to compare your code to well-known
similar libraries. By specifying this role, you expect the model to provide a detailed critique
on the features, performance, and usability of your code and to suggest
specific improvements. Let's go ahead and
run this in GPT. As you can see, the model responds with a deep
critique of the code, followed by suggestions
for how to enhance it. Take some time to read
the contents or try the same prompt with
an LLM yourself but you can see that the
answer here is very detailed and has lots of actionable items to
improve the code. For example, in this key
improvement section at the end, the LLM summarizes changes
it has implemented, including flexible data input, more plot types,
customization options, and a whole lot more. Next, let's take a look
at how to work with an LLM to explore the integration
of advanced features. Suppose we want to enhance
an existing application with AI capabilities like
natural language processing. You'll start with
this code and assign GPT the role of an NLP
expert to analyze it. Here, you're encouraging the
model to not just critique, but also provide suggestions
for applying state of the art NLP techniques to improve the
functionality of your app, and here's how it responds. It fixes an error in the
class initialization, and then offers some suggestions to improve the code like text pre-processing and more advanced NLP methods for summarization. This is exactly the
kind of thing you'd expect from a code reviewer
working alongside you, particularly if they
were an NLP expert. Let's pivot to
another role and use the expertise of
the role to help us be a better coder and that's the role of a software tester. Software testers
have many skills, but one of my favorites is their innate ability to find corner and edge cases for code. Let's see if GPT can
help us with that. Here's some code. You'll
assign the model, the role of a software
tester to see how it can help you identify and
mitigate edge cases. Here, by focusing on
robustness in software, you're directing the AI to consider not just
normal operations, but also unusual or
extreme conditions that could cause failures. If you just use GPT
with this role, prompt and code, you'll
get feedback like this. There's a lot here.
Spend some time to watch the video and read
through the feedback. Also, take some time to try this prompt and
code for yourself. The most important takeaways
here are that the model understood what you
wanted when you assigned the software
test a role. It has identified a number
of potential edge cases, described them, and then suggested strategies
for handling them. It also wrote a
nice Python script that contains tests
for these edge cases. Lastly, let's discuss how
AI can be integrated into typical development
workflows from planning through to
testing and deployment, enhancing all of these processes
with AI-driven insights. You could use AI to automate part of the
code review process, identify potential optimizations
during development, or even assist in generating documentation based
on the code base. The possibilities are
extensive and can significantly
increase efficiency and accuracy in development. By carefully crafting
prompts that result in detailed
knowledgeable responses, you can harness
AI's potential to tackle complex problems
and streamline workflows. I would encourage you to
keep experimenting with these techniques and see how they can transform
your projects.
