You've now started experimenting
with using an LLM like ChatGPT to help you be a better coder by
exploring prompting, ongoing conversations
to improve code, and using roles like
expert software engineer or beginners tutor. In this module, you're going
to explore data structures, the kind that you might study in undergraduate
computer science. Now you might be thinking, what? I already understand
data structures like arrays or linked lists,
and you'd be right. But what I find exciting is how these can
really help you go deeper into understanding
engineering problems, like scalability,
maintainability, security, and a whole lot more. Let's have some fun
in this module, dusting off some
of our old ideas about things like link
lists, trees, or graphs. But we're going to
go much deeper into building production code
with an LLM by our side.
