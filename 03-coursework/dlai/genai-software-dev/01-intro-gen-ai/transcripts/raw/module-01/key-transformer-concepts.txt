There are two key concepts that form the foundation of
how transformers work. You'll explore those in
more detail in this video. The first is attention. In essence, attention allows
the model to focus on specific parts of the input text when predicting the next word, like you just did with my secondary school
example sentence. Attention considers the
relationships between words in a sentence to understand the context and predict
the upcoming word. For example, if you
had a sentence like my little white fluffy
dog ran towards my guest, the attention
mechanism would allow for the model to focus
on the adjectives, little, white, and fluffy when predicting the meaning
of the noun dog. This would help the model to understand that the
dog is likely to be something that's greeting my guest and not attacking them. The model might predict
and greeted them enthusiastically as the text
that completes the sentence. But how exactly does this
attention mechanism work? Let's take a closer look at how the text is represented
by the model. Text is broken down into
pieces called tokens, which are mostly
individual words, but they're occasionally
pieces of words. Each word is assigned a
high dimensional vector, which is a mathematical representation of
the words meaning. This vector is
called an embedding. The attention mechanism
helps to adjust these embeddings to account for the context of the
surrounding words. For example, here,
little, white, and fluffy will impact the
values of the dog vector, changing it to more
resemble them. The model then goes through multiple attention blocks where the embeddings are
updated repeatedly. As a result, details
about the words and the sentences are used to
learn the underlying concepts, and with proper tuning, they can very accurately determine the
underlying semantics and thus generate
semantically accurate text to follow a phrase. Overall, the attention mechanism is a powerful tool that allows transformers to capture
the complex relationships between words and a sentence. This is essential for tasks
such as machine translation, text summarization, and
question answering. The second concept is that
of encoders and decoders. Imagine you're
working on a piece of code that's part of
a complex code base. Before you add or
modify anything, you need to understand
the entire context, what each part of the code does and how it interacts
with other parts. That's pretty much
what the encoder in a transformer model
will do with text. When we're training a
transformer base model, the encoder takes the entire
input sequence at once. Unlike traditional
supervised models, that process data step by step, the encoder looks at all parts of the
data simultaneously. This is possible, thanks to the attention mechanisms
that we described earlier. Remember, they allow
the encoder to focus on different parts
of the input sequencing, determining which features
are the most important. You could see this process as somewhat like a code review, where you might focus more on
the critical sections that could impact the functionality
of the entire application. After processing,
the encoder converts the input data into a
set of context vectors. These vectors are a
distilled representation of the input text, encapsulating the learned
insights and relationships between different elements of the data thanks to the
attention mechanism. The decoder reverses
this process. In a way you can think
about this in terms of a code review and the insights that you've
gained from it. You're no longer just reviewing
you're planning what to code next based on the understanding that
you've just developed. I like to call this
artificial understanding. Through the many
pieces of intelligence that are gleaned through
the attention mechanism, the model understands a lot of context about what you're
currently working on with it, and as a result, can intelligently suggest
new content to you. When it comes to using
transformer-based models, like you will be
extensively in this course. It is important to have this basic understanding
of how they work. There's no magic
or secret sauce, just an excellent algorithm that understands your context, such as code you feed it
and ask it to analyze, and it can then
apply reasoning on that context to give
very relevant output, like finding bugs in the code. As a developer, it always
helps to understand at least some of the
technical details underlying the
tools you're using, and the same is true
here for an LLM. Let's quickly review
the main concepts that you saw in this module. First, you saw a quick summary of supervised machine learning. The idea here is that
models can be trained on labeled datasets in order to find underlying
rules and patterns. These rules can then
be applied to new data to make predictions or to
generate useful output. The more or higher quality
data used in training, in general, the higher quality output the
model will give you. Large language
models are built on an architecture
called a transformer. Transformers are
particularly good at processing large
bodies of text, whether it's a software
library or a book. Using a concept
called attention, they can track relationships
between words or concepts, even if they're not close
to each other in the text. LLMs available to you
will have been trained on almost unfathomably
large datasets of text, including a ton of code. This training allows
them both to understand long or nuanced prompts
and generate new text, for example, code that best
matches what you asked for. I'm sure you're excited to
start thinking about how best to use these models in your work as a
software engineer, and that's what you're
going to learn about in the next module.
I'll see you there.
