An industry,
supervised learning is a giant. It's more prevalent than all other AI
domains like unsupervised learning or reinforcement learning. Because it has direct applications
in our day to day technology, from email filtering to
personal assistance. Supervised learning forms the backbone
of systems that require reliable and accurate predictions based on past data. So what exactly is supervised learning? Well, it involves training a model on
a dataset that includes inputs paired with correct outputs as we saw earlier
with the activity detection example. This method is akin to teaching
a child with flashcards. Each question comes with an answer and the task is to learn those pairs
in order to make predictions. Think about some everyday email systems
that are trained to identify spam based on features within good emails
as well as spam ones. Or medical imaging systems that learn
from thousands of retina images tagged with diagnoses. These systems rely on high quality labeled
data to learn how to respond accurately to new information. And the core underlying
principle of machine learning is that it can learn to match
the data to the labels. One really interesting real world
example comes from medicine and the diabetic retinopathy example. Diabetic retinopathy is the world's
fastest growing cause of preventable blindness and it is relatively easily
mitigated with regular screening. Every diabetic person should be
screened yearly with a special camera that takes a picture of the back
of the eye, the retina. But in many parts of the world there
simply arent enough specialists to do this. In India, for example, theres a shortage of many thousands of
eye doctors to do that scanning and as a result, almost half of patients will
suffer vision loss before any diagnosis. And this is a tragedy because
the disease is completely preventable. In order to address this doctor shortage,
researchers turned to machine learning. They created a dataset of tens of
thousands of retinal scans that were graded by doctors on a five point scale
from no issues all the way up to advanced disease. Doctors would spot patterns like
hemorrhages, as you can see here. The researchers then used the resulting
data and human assigned labels to train a machine learning algorithm
to match one to the other and carry out the same feature
spotting as the doctors. So this model enables a computer to learn
how to diagnose images as well as, and sometimes even better than, a human. But machine learning can sometimes
find other interesting relationships in the data set. In this case, the retina images weren't
just labeled with disease features, but also other data like the patient's age,
their birth, assigned gender, blood pressure readings and so on. And because supervised learning
matches data to labels, the algorithm here has learned to match
the images to all of the labels, and in the process, reveals something new. The model was able to correctly
predict a person's birth, assigned gender from the retina
image 97% of the time. Somehow it could see this label in
the images in a way that humans cannot. A human will get this right
about 50% of the time, the same odds as flipping a coin. So, supervised learning is a very
powerful technique that can be applied to different kinds of labeled data,
from images to sounds and text. In fact, it's supervised learning using
text data that has led to the development of the powerful large language models that
power chatbots and other applications. LLMs like ChatGPT, or Gemini are trained
on vast amounts of text data, where the model learns the relationships
between sequences of words and what naturally follows. Enabling it to predict
the next word repeatedly and thus to continue to generate coherent and
contextually relevant text on its own. Well, look at those next. Starting with the transformer
architecture, which makes the generation of text and the artificial
simulation of reasoning possible.
