Now let's dive into
the engine room of modern AI specifically the
transformer architecture. This revolutionary
design has become a game changer for natural
language processing. You'll unpack the basics
of how transformers work, see how they've
paved the way for the advanced large
language models like GPT or Gemini that have so quickly captured public
attention and started to revolutionize what it looks like to be a software developer. First introduced in the paper, Attention Is All You Need
by Vaswani et al in 2017. The transformer model
brought a new approach to machine learning
models for handling sequences of
information like text. Earlier you saw how
supervised learning worked. A computer learns to predict
data that was labeled, and a machine learned to
match the data to the label, like a retina to a
doctor's opinion of the state of disease
within that retina. More complex algorithms such as recurrent neural networks, started to learn about
the sequences of data. Now, this was really useful for models that could
predict what would happen next in a system as opposed to predicting
what they see. For text, these could
be pretty good, but they were limited in understanding the
deep meaning in text. The big idea behind
transformers is that they process all parts of
the data simultaneously. This parallel
processing capability not only speeds up training, but also improves the ability to handle long range
dependencies in text. Now, let's take a look
and see what this means. Consider this
sentence. In Ireland, I went to secondary school, so I had to study blank. How would you finish
this sentence? Let's explore that a little bit. First, secondary school is the equivalent to high
school elsewhere. It's for older children
studying more advanced things. Of course, Ireland is a country, so there may be topics that someone would study in Ireland, that people in other
countries may not, which is why I put the emphasis on that country in the sentence, instead of just saying,
I had to study. As a human, you paid
attention to those words and the full context of the sentence may lead you
to predict that the blank, the next token is Irish or Gaelic indicating the
language, and you'll be right. That's what gives the title to the paper that
presented transformers. Attention is all you need. Now, the details of transformers
are highly technical, and I'm not going to go into
all of the specifics here. That would be a full
course in its own right. But there are two key concepts that I think are important
for you to know. Let's go on to the next video
to explore those concepts.
