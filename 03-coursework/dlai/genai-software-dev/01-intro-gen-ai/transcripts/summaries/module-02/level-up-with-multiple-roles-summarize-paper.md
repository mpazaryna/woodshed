# Level Up with Multiple Roles

## Main Goal and Fundamental Concept

The primary objective of the research is to demonstrate how combining multiple roles within a language model (LLM) can enhance the complexity and insightfulness of the model's responses. The core idea is to leverage role-based prompting to obtain comprehensive feedback on a Python script for a web application, covering both architecture and security aspects.

## Technical Approach

The methodology involves framing a prompt to the LLM (ChatGPT) to act as both a software architect and a security expert. By defining these roles explicitly in the prompt and providing a code snippet for analysis, the model is guided to evaluate the script from both architectural and security perspectives. The software architect aspect assesses the structure, scalability, performance, and design pattern suitability, while the security expert aspect scrutinizes vulnerabilities such as secure data handling and potential exposure to attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting.

## Distinctive Features

This research is distinctive because it combines multiple expert roles within a single LLM prompt, which enables the model to generate more nuanced and multifaceted feedback. The innovative approach of using advanced roles transforms the LLM into a more powerful tool for software development and project planning.

## Experimental Setup and Results

The experimental setup involves providing the LLM with a prompt that includes the defined roles and a Python script. The model's response is analyzed to see if it can identify architectural issues and security vulnerabilities. The results showed that the model could spot significant vulnerabilities, such as the use of a text file as a database and storing usernames and passwords in clear text. Additionally, the model suggested an improved script, demonstrating its ability to provide actionable advice.

## Advantages and Limitations

The strengths of this approach include the ability to obtain comprehensive and actionable feedback from a single LLM prompt, enhancing the utility of the model in software development contexts. However, the limitation is that the effectiveness of the feedback depends on the accuracy and depth of the model's understanding of both roles. There may also be challenges in ensuring that the model does not overlook critical issues in either domain.

## Conclusion

The paper's technical approach showcases the potential of combining multiple expert roles within a language model to generate insightful and actionable feedback on software scripts. This method stands out due to its ability to provide comprehensive evaluations from both architectural and security perspectives. While it offers significant advantages in terms of depth and utility of feedback, its effectiveness is contingent on the model's proficiency in both roles.
