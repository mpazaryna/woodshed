## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Leveraging LLMs for code generation requires understanding and questioning their output to avoid technical debt and enhance development skills.

## MAIN POINTS:
1. Linked lists are a common computer science assignment for understanding data structures.
2. LLMs can generate code but relying solely on them without understanding can lead to technical debt.
3. Linked lists allow flexible insertion and deletion without shifting elements like arrays.
4. They have their own overheads and potential downsides, such as cache performance issues.
5. Pair programming with LLMs can enhance understanding and coding skills.
6. Different responses from LLMs provide varied insights, similar to colleagues' differing opinions.
7. Asking LLMs for clarification deepens understanding of code and underlying problems.
8. Don't use LLM-generated code blindly; consider deeper implications and security risks.
9. LLMs can help mitigate risks by improving code with techniques like input validation and concurrency control.
10. Use LLMs to explore complex data structures and potential production environment issues.

## TAKEAWAYS:
1. Use LLMs as a learning tool, not just a code generator, to enhance development skills.
2. Always question and understand the code generated by LLMs to avoid technical debt.
3. Collaborate with LLMs as you would with human colleagues for diverse insights.
4. Ensure code security and performance by probing LLMs about potential risks.
5. Explore and learn about complex data structures with LLM guidance for better code implementation.
