# SECURITY TESTING

Security testing is crucial for applications, as vulnerabilities like SQL injection require expert oversight beyond LLMs' capabilities.

## MAIN POINTS

1. Security testing is essential for applications, especially those with public APIs.
2. LLMs can assist but shouldn't replace expert security analysis.
3. LLMs have knowledge cutoffs and may miss recent vulnerabilities.
4. Best practices for security can be obtained from LLMs.
5. Security requires deep understanding, not just reliance on LLMs.
6. LLMs can facilitate team communication by simulating security experts.
7. Example: A simple web-based REST API for user management is discussed.
8. Potential security issue: SQL injection in applications with databases.
9. SQL injection can manipulate database queries with malicious input.
10. Real security experts are necessary to ensure comprehensive protection.

## TAKEAWAYS

1. Relying solely on LLMs for security testing is risky.
2. Constantly evolving threats require up-to-date knowledge.
3. LLMs can assist but need human oversight for security.
4. SQL injection remains a common and dangerous vulnerability.
5. Combining LLMs with expert insights enhances application security.
