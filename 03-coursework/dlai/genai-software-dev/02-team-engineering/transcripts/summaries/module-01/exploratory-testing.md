# EXPLORATORY TESTING

The video explores using exploratory testing with an LLM for Python apps, focusing on identifying bugs and potential improvements.

## MAIN POINTS

1. Early development often involves manual testing without automated tools.
2. Exploratory testing involves using the app like a user without predefined test cases.
3. Tasks in the example app include adding, removing, and listing tasks.
4. Testing edge cases can reveal unexpected issues like allowing empty tasks.
5. LLMs can assist in identifying edge cases and suggesting code improvements.
6. Global variables and thread safety are potential issues in multi-threaded environments.
7. Consistent return types are necessary for clearer function outputs.
8. Handling task duplication and empty tasks improves app functionality.
9. Thread locking ensures thread safety in multi-user environments.
10. Developing with testing in mind simplifies code handover to colleagues.

## TAKEAWAYS

1. Exploratory testing is crucial for identifying bugs early in development.
2. LLMs can effectively assist in exploratory testing by suggesting improvements.
3. Handling edge cases and thread safety is vital for robust applications.
4. Consistency in function return types and inputs enhances app reliability.
5. Formalizing exploratory testing results into functional tests is the next development step.
