Congratulations, you've made it to the end
of this course on using AI to help you and your extended team with
software development. Let's take a look back at what
you've seen in this course. You started by exploring the ways
that LLMs can be used to aid in software testing, and that was whether you were performing exploratory functional
performance or security testing. LLMs were able to help you brainstorm
scenarios that you would want to test for and then write those tests alongside you. Next, we explored documentation. From inline comments all the way up
to full API documentation and beyond. LLMs were able to help you develop clear,
comprehensive, and useful documentation. And with better documentation, your team
is better able to use one another's code onboard new teammates and
maintain your code over the long term. Finally, you saw how LLMs can
address many of the challenges of dependency management. Now, whether you're exploring
which libraries are available for you to use, learning more
about a particular library, or even addressing dependency related
challenges like version conflicts or vulnerabilities, LLMs can offer targeted
advice based on your teams needs. I hope this course has demonstrated that
as well as helping you be a better coder, LLMs can help you grow beyond yourself and have the tools to be a better part of
a professional software engineering team. Happy coding.
