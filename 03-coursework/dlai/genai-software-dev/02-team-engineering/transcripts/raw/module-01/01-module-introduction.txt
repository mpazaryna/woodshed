The importance of software
testing can't be overstated. It's a fundamental step in the development process that
ensures that you launch high quality correctly
functioning products that result in great
experiences for your users. As a software developer, you can really help
keep the wheels of your project turning
if you think about software testing
and the needs of your testing colleagues at
every stage of your work. Luckily, you can now use an
LLM as a partner to do this, even when the software testers might be busy with
other projects. Being more familiar
with the discipline of software testing as a whole will help you be a
better colleague, save you time, reduce bugs, and improve the overall
quality of your code. Without proper testing,
you risk releasing software that could fail
in unpredictable ways, leading to frustrated users, potential financial
losses or worse. A famous example of a dramatic software failure
is the Mars climate orbiter. After it launched in
1998 and successfully traveled over 100 million
kilometers to Mars, the probe missed its
target orbital altitude by just a few kilometers. The root cause, a simple unit conversion error between the software
created by different teams. One team use metric units and the other use
imperial units. This mismatch caused
the spacecraft to deviate from its
intended trajectory, and it ultimately disintegrated in the Martian atmosphere. This small coding error
resulted in the loss of a $200,000,000 mission and years of amazing scientific
discoveries, and it could have been caught
with more thorough testing. Over the next few videos, you'll explore the importance of testing and debugging and the various types of
tests that you can implement in the context
of simple applications. You'll start by exploring several different types
of manual testing, including exploratory
and functional testing. You'll learn how to implement these tests with the help
of large language models. Next, you're going to dive into automated
testing frameworks. One of the things
I've continually encountered and experienced
during my career is that the cognitive load
of trying to figure out test scripts
and test cases to get the most out of
an automated tool can sometimes lead to
them being ignored, and if that's you, then I
would really encourage you to spend some time on this
lesson in particular, because working alongside an LLM can be enormously helpful there. After that, you're going to
explore performance testing, and you'll see how you can
work with an AI to ensure that our application performs really well under different
conditions and loads. Finally, you'll look at
techniques to use an LLM to identify and fix security vulnerabilities
in your software, and it will help you have
productive conversations with your security
expert colleagues. There's a whole lot of exciting
stuff to consider here. Let's go onto the
next video and get started by looking at
testing strategies.
