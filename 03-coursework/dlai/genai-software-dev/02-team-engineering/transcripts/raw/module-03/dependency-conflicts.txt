A common challenge when working with
dependencies are dependency conflicts. Let's remind ourselves why these happen
and see how LLMs can help us resolve them. Dependency conflicts can occur when
different packages require different versions of the same dependency. This can lead to compatibility issues and
errors in your project. Think of it like this, your app
might use two frameworks, A and B. Framework A has a dependency on
version one of a library, but framework B has dependency on
version two of the same library. You can't fix this with a virtual
environment because there's only one app. So what can you do? Well, of course there's no one
size fits all answer to this, but here is where an LLM as your
assistant can be really helpful, and it's good to follow a framework
when trying to figure it out. I like to follow these steps. First is to identify the conflict and figure out which dependencies
are causing the issue. One great way to do this is to upload your
requirements txt file to your LLM and ask it to identify if there
are conflicts between the libraries. Your mileage may vary, but
it is a really useful shortcut, and it might give you the solution right away. Next, look for compatibility. Is there a version of
the library that works for all libraries in the dependency chain? Your LLM may be able to make suggestions
if that information does exist in its training data. And then of course, the final step is
to update your dependencies based on any recommendations and
keep iterating until it works. It's very rare that by using an approach
like this, that you may not fix the issue, but if you do,
you'll have two ways forward. The first,
you'll typically have a well-known issue, which means they'll be
well-documented workarounds. If the LLM doesn't know about them,
a traditional web or stack overflow search could likely help. The second, and here's where
an LLM would be really useful, is to find alternative libraries that
have a different dependency chain. An LLM can help you find a different
library that fits your needs and then refactor your code
to use that library. For example, here's some code, and this uses the common requests library in
Python to retrieve data from a given URL. Now imagine you're in a scenario where
this module uses requests which has a dependency on, say, Version 1 of
the library, and another module uses a different framework which
depends on Version 2 of that library. Situations like this,
as we discussed earlier, can easily lead to a dependency
conflict in your app. One way forward would be to ask
the LLM for an alternative, and now it tells me about a library called
HTTPX, and it becomes a trivial task for me to refactor my code to use
HTTPX instead of requests. In fact, this is probably something I
could ask the LLM to help me do, and here you can see that I just needed
to make a couple of adjustments in a few places in my code, at which point
I can now try to see if everything works dependency wise again and iterate
myself towards the desired solution. As with everything, there isn't
a one size fits all solution for dependency management and
resolving dependency conflicts. But hopefully these quick examples
are helpful for you to see how you can get assistance from an LLM when faced
with these difficult problems. I hope you'll join me in the next video
where we'll talk about using LLMs to address vulnerabilities that arise as
a result of taking dependencies in your projects.
