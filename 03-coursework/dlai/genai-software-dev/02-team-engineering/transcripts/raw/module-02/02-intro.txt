In this module, you'll
explore the importance of documentation in
software development, both as a means to
making your code better and easier to use and as a tool to facilitate
communication with your team members and
other stakeholders. Now, you're probably thinking,
documentation is easy. You just write text that
explains what the code does, remember the right syntax for the comment
strings, and move on. You've been doing this since
your early days of coding, so why include it
here in this course? Well, as much as we all spend our time writing documentation and think we're good at it, you'll probably encounter
code all of the time in your work where you
think, who wrote this? It's such a mess. I have
no idea what's going on. That's because writing
good documentation is actually an art. There are many schools of
thought about what makes good code documentation from those who think it should
be as minimal as possible, because beautiful code
just speaks for itself, or those who just like
to add comments to every other line just
to make sure there's no ambiguity in the
intent of the code. If you ask an LLM what it knows about writing good
code documentation, it will probably
respond by writing a many bullet point essay,
a little bit like this, offering up ideas about the principles of
good documentation, good writing, the structure
of documentation, writing to a specific
audience, and so on. Clearly, there's a
lot to consider. For the next few videos, we'll try to go
back to basics and think through both best
practices for writing good documentation yourself and how an LLM can best support
you in that effort. After all, code documentation is an important means of
communication with others, be your developer
colleagues, code testers, security experts, or engineering
partners who need to figure out how to
deploy your code. The better your documentation, the easier everybody's
job will be. Let's start by heading to
the next video and thinking through what really makes good documentation
