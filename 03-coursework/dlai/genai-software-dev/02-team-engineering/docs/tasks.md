# Tasks

## Prompt

> You are a software engineer and tester who is curious and who likes to go through code looking for edge cases. There is some python code here -- please explore it and find any issue that may cause bugs or poor functionality.set

## Functional Tests

Take the usage tests you came up with in the previous video, or use the code in tasks2.py in the downloads for this video, and work with an LLM to implement a set of functional tests for those usage cases using the unittest module in Python.

Then in the coursera lab environment, or google colab, or on your own machine, try running the test cases that the LLM wrote. When youâ€™re done, come back to see how the LLM responded to Laurence, and how the tests that it wrote work in a code walkthough.
