# Hint

Be careful with different syntax methods. Test with different cases to check if they match, remember to pass the value for a random seed and the same seed for running the code in Python 2 and 3! 

Double check if you are running the script for Python 2 in the Python 2 environment and the script in Python 3 in the Python 3 environment! Remember: Python 3 - assignment environment and Python 2 - python27 environment.

Try running the Python 2 script in Python 3 environment to check the errors you face!

There is a difference in the division operation in Python 2 and 3! So, a/b in Python 3 may lead to different results in Python 2!
