# Best Practices for Woodshed Documentation

## 1. In-Code Documentation

The `structured_data.py` file demonstrates excellent in-code documentation practices:

- Comprehensive module-level docstring explaining the purpose and contents of the file
- Detailed class and function docstrings using a consistent format
- Type hints and Pydantic models for clear data structures
- Inline comments for complex logic (though not heavily needed in this example)

Continue this practice for all your code files. It makes the code self-explanatory and easier to understand when you revisit it.

## 2. Separate Markdown Files

For more extensive explanations, concepts, and notes that go beyond direct code documentation, create separate Markdown files. This approach offers several benefits:

- Keeps code files clean and focused on implementation
- Allows for more detailed explanations without cluttering the code
- Enables easy linking between related concepts
- Facilitates better organization of complex ideas

### Suggested Structure:

```
woodshed_project/
├── src/
│   └── structured_data.py
├── docs/
│   ├── concepts/
│   │   ├── language_models.md
│   │   └── structured_output.md
│   ├── notes/
│   │   └── implementation_challenges.md
│   └── examples/
│       └── joke_generation_example.md
└── README.md
```

## 3. README.md

Maintain a comprehensive README.md at the root of your project. This should include:

- Project overview
- Setup instructions
- Basic usage examples
- Links to more detailed documentation

## 4. Linking Documentation

Use relative links in your Markdown files to connect related concepts and code:

```markdown
For more details on how we use language models, see [Language Models](./docs/concepts/language_models.md).

The implementation can be found in [`structured_data.py`](./src/structured_data.py).
```

## 5. Version Control

Use version control (e.g., Git) to track changes in both your code and documentation. This allows you to see how your understanding and implementation evolve over time.

## 6. Regular Review and Updates

As you progress through your woodshed process, regularly review and update your documentation. This helps reinforce your learning and ensures your notes remain accurate and useful.

By combining these practices, you'll create a comprehensive, navigable knowledge base that enhances your learning process and serves as a valuable reference for future projects.
