# Revised Insights Structure for AI-Assisted Development

## Updated Recommendation

Create a centralized `insights` directory at the root of your monorepo:

```
monorepo-root/
├── insights/
│   ├── templates/
│   │   └── insight_template.md
│   ├── ai-prompts/
│   │   └── [ai-specific-prompts].md
│   ├── design-decisions/
│   │   ├── [project1]/
│   │   │   └── [decision-documents].md
│   │   ├── [project2]/
│   │   │   └── [decision-documents].md
│   │   └── cross-project/
│   │       └── [shared-decision-documents].md
│   └── learning-journey/
│       ├── progress-log.md
│       └── skills-acquired.md
├── projects/
│   ├── project1/
│   ├── project2/
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

## Rationale

1. **Centralized Access**: Placing all insights in a root-level `insights` directory makes them easily accessible across all projects and for AI interactions.

2. **AI-Prompt Ready**: The `ai-prompts` subdirectory can store prompts specifically crafted for AI interactions, making them readily available when you're using AI to generate code.

3. **Organized Decision History**: The `design-decisions` subdirectory organizes decisions by project and includes a `cross-project` folder for shared or overarching decisions.

4. **Template Consistency**: Keeping templates in a dedicated `templates` subdirectory ensures consistency across all insight documents.

5. **Learning Journey Integration**: The `learning-journey` subdirectory maintains the portfolio aspect, documenting your overall progress and skills acquisition.

6. **Scalability**: This structure scales well as you add more projects and accumulate more insights over time.

7. **Easy Reference**: When working with AI, you can quickly reference or include relevant insights from any project, enhancing the context you provide to AI tools.

## Implementation Steps

1. Create the `insights` directory at the root of your monorepo.
2. Set up the subdirectories: `templates`, `ai-prompts`, `design-decisions`, and `learning-journey`.
3. Move existing insight documents from other projects/repos into the appropriate subdirectories under `design-decisions`.
4. Create project-specific folders within `design-decisions` as needed.
5. Relocate or create AI-specific prompts in the `ai-prompts` directory.
6. Ensure your insight template is placed in the `templates` subdirectory.
7. Update any existing references or links to insight documents in your projects.

## Benefits for AI-Assisted Development

- Quick access to all insights when crafting prompts for AI
- Easy cross-referencing of decisions across projects
- Centralized location for AI-specific prompts and guidelines
- Maintained history of design decisions that can inform future AI interactions
- Clear structure for documenting both project-specific and overarching insights

## Adapting Your Workflow

1. When creating new insights, save them directly to the relevant project folder in `insights/design-decisions/`.
2. Before AI coding sessions, review relevant insights in the centralized directory to inform your prompts.
3. Regularly update the `learning-journey` documents to reflect your progress across all projects.
4. Use the `ai-prompts` directory to store and refine prompts that have been particularly effective in generating code or solving problems.

This structure maintains the portfolio aspect of your work while prioritizing the accessibility and utility of your insights for AI-assisted development.
