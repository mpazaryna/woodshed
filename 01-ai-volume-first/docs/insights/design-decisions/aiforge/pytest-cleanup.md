# Function Insight: `cleanup`

## Function Signature

```python
@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
def cleanup(output_files):
    yield
    if os.environ.get("KEEP_TEST_FILES", "").lower() != "true":
        for file_path in output_files.values():
            if file_path.exists():
                file_path.unlink()
    else:
        print("\nTest files were not deleted. You can find them at:")
        for key, file_path in output_files.items():
            if file_path.exists():
                print(f"- {key}: {file_path}")
```

## Description

The `cleanup` function is a pytest fixture designed to manage the cleanup of test output files after test execution. It provides a flexible mechanism to either remove test files automatically or retain them for further inspection, based on an environment variable.

## Key Components

1. **Pytest Fixture Decorator**:
   - `@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)`: This decorator marks the function as a pytest fixture and sets it to run automatically for all tests in the file.

2. **Function Parameters**:
   - `output_files`: A dictionary containing key-value pairs of file identifiers and their corresponding `Path` objects.

3. **Yield Statement**:
   - `yield`: This allows the test to run and complete before executing the cleanup code.

4. **Environment Variable Check**:
   - Checks the `KEEP_TEST_FILES` environment variable to determine whether to delete files or keep them.

5. **File Deletion Logic**:
   - If `KEEP_TEST_FILES` is not set to "true" (case-insensitive), it iterates through the `output_files` dictionary and deletes each existing file.

6. **File Retention Logic**:
   - If `KEEP_TEST_FILES` is set to "true", it prints the locations of the test files that were not deleted.

## Usage

1. **In Test Files**:
   - The fixture is set to `autouse=True`, so it will run automatically for all tests in the file where it's defined.
   - Tests should use the `output_files` fixture to get the paths for saving output files.

2. **Running Tests**:
   - Normal execution: `pytest test_file.py`
   - To keep test files: `KEEP_TEST_FILES=true pytest test_file.py`

## Benefits and Use Cases

1. **Automatic Cleanup**:
   - Ensures that test output files are automatically removed after each test run, preventing cluttering of the test environment.

2. **Debugging Aid**:
   - Allows developers to keep test output files for inspection by setting an environment variable, facilitating easier debugging of test failures.

3. **Consistent File Management**:
   - Provides a centralized and consistent way to manage test output files across multiple tests.

4. **Flexible File Handling**:
   - Can easily be extended to handle different types of files or perform more complex cleanup operations.

5. **Environment-Specific Behavior**:
   - Allows for different behaviors in different environments (e.g., local development vs. CI/CD pipelines) through the use of environment variables.

6. **Reduced Boilerplate**:
   - Eliminates the need for repetitive cleanup code in individual tests.

## Best Practices and Considerations

1. **File Path Management**:
   - Use a separate fixture (like `output_files`) to manage file paths, promoting reusability and maintainability.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Consider adding try-except blocks to handle potential errors during file deletion.

3. **Logging**:
   - Implement logging for cleanup actions, especially in CI/CD environments where console output might be limited.

4. **Customization**:
   - The fixture can be easily customized to handle different file types or perform additional cleanup tasks as needed.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Clearly document the purpose and usage of the `KEEP_TEST_FILES` environment variable in the project's README or testing documentation.

## Implications

The implementation of the `cleanup` function has several important implications for the project going forward:

1. **Improved Test Isolation**: By automatically cleaning up test files, each test run starts with a clean slate, reducing the risk of inter-test dependencies and improving overall test reliability.

2. **Enhanced Debugging Capabilities**: The ability to selectively keep test files allows for more efficient debugging processes, potentially reducing the time needed to identify and fix issues.

3. **Scalability**: As the project grows and more tests are added, this centralized cleanup mechanism will help maintain a manageable test environment without manual intervention.

4. **Standardization**: It sets a standard for how test file cleanup should be handled across the project, promoting consistency and reducing potential confusion among team members.

5. **CI/CD Integration**: The environment variable control allows for easy integration with CI/CD pipelines, where different cleanup behaviors might be desired for different stages of the pipeline.

6. **Future Extensibility**: The structure of the `cleanup` function allows for easy extension to handle more complex cleanup scenarios or additional types of test artifacts in the future.
