# Development Insight: Config Import Duplication in Main and Test Files

## Context

In our project, we have a configuration module (`config.py`) that is used in both the main code (`async_scraper.py`) and its corresponding test file (`test_async_scraper.py`). We considered whether to keep the import statement in both files or try to reduce this duplication.

## Decision

We decided to keep the `from aiforge.config import config` import statement in both the main code file (`async_scraper.py`) and the test file (`test_async_scraper.py`).

## Rationale

While it might seem redundant at first glance, having the import in both files is actually a good practice for several reasons:

1. Independence: Each file should be able to stand on its own. If someone wants to use or test just the `async_scraper.py` functionality, they shouldn't have to import anything extra.

2. Explicit dependencies: By importing `config` in both files, we're making it clear that both the main code and the test code depend on this configuration.

3. Ease of mocking: In tests, we might want to mock or override the config for specific test cases. Having the import in the test file makes this easier.

4. Avoiding circular imports: If the test file relied on importing `config` through `async_scraper.py`, it could potentially lead to circular import issues if the structure of the imports changes in the future.

5. Clarity and readability: Having the import in both files makes the dependencies immediately clear to anyone reading the code. This is especially helpful for new team members or when revisiting the code after some time.

6. Minimal overhead: The duplication is minimal â€“ it's just one import line. The benefits in terms of clarity and maintainability outweigh this small duplication.

7. Flexibility for future changes: If we ever need to change how configuration is handled in either the main code or the tests, we have the flexibility to do so independently.

## Alternatives Considered

1. Importing `config` only in `async_scraper.py` and accessing it through this module in the test file.
2. Creating a pytest fixture to provide `config` to all test files.

## Implications

- Maintaining this approach will ensure that our files remain self-contained and easy to understand.
- It sets a precedent for handling similar situations in other parts of the project.
- We may need to explain this decision to new team members who might question the apparent duplication.
