# Graph Data Structures Study Guide

## Concept Overview

Graphs are data structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph consists of vertices (also called nodes) and edges (connections between nodes). Graphs can be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted, and can contain cycles or be acyclic.

## Implementation

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.graph = {}

    def add_vertex(self, vertex):
        if vertex not in self.graph:
            self.graph[vertex] = []

    def add_edge(self, vertex1, vertex2):
        if vertex1 in self.graph and vertex2 in self.graph:
            self.graph[vertex1].append(vertex2)
            self.graph[vertex2].append(vertex1)  # For undirected graph

    def display(self):
        for vertex in self.graph:
            print(f"{vertex} -> {self.graph[vertex]}")

# Example usage
g = Graph()
g.add_vertex('A')
g.add_vertex('B')
g.add_edge('A', 'B')
g.display()
```

## Key Points

### IDEAS

- Graphs model relationships between objects using nodes and edges effectively and efficiently.
- Directed graphs have edges with a direction, indicating a one-way relationship.
- Undirected graphs have bidirectional edges, indicating a two-way relationship.
- Weighted graphs assign a weight or cost to each edge, representing distance or cost.
- Graph traversal algorithms include Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).

### RECOMMENDATIONS

- Use adjacency lists for sparse graphs to save memory and improve performance.
- Use adjacency matrices for dense graphs to simplify edge existence checks.
- Implement graph algorithms like Dijkstra's for shortest path calculations.
- Consider graph libraries like NetworkX for complex graph operations.
- Visualize graphs to better understand their structure and relationships.

### HABITS

- Regularly practice implementing graph algorithms to strengthen understanding.
- Analyze the time and space complexity of graph operations.
