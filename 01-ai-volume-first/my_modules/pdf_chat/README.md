# PDF Chat Application

## Overview

This module provides functionality for chatting with PDF documents. It includes functions for processing PDF files, creating knowledge bases, and answering questions based on the content of the PDFs using OpenAI's language models and embeddings.

### Key Features:

- **PDF Text Extraction**: Extracts text content from PDF files.
- **Text Processing and Embedding**: Processes extracted text and creates embeddings for efficient searching.
- **Question-Answering**: Uses OpenAI's language models to answer questions based on the content of the PDFs.

### Dependencies:

- `langchain`
- `pypdf`
- `faiss`
- `openai`

### Type Hinting:

This module uses type hints to improve code readability and maintainability:
- `Optional`: Indicates that a value can be of a specified type or `None`.
- `Tuple`: Represents a fixed-size collection of elements.
- `Union`: Indicates that a value can be one of several types (e.g., `Union[str, bytes]` means a value can be either a string or bytes).

## Context Managers

### What are Context Managers?

Context managers in Python are a way to manage resources efficiently, ensuring that they are properly acquired and released. They are commonly used for managing file operations, network connections, and other resources that require setup and teardown.

### Benefits of Using Context Managers:

1. **Automatic Resource Management**: Context managers automatically handle resource allocation and deallocation. For example, when working with files, a context manager ensures that the file is closed after its block of code is executed, even if an error occurs.
  
2. **Cleaner Code**: Using context managers can lead to cleaner and more readable code by reducing the need for explicit try-finally blocks.

3. **Custom Context Managers**: You can create your own context managers using classes or the `contextlib` module, allowing for reusable and maintainable resource management.

## Functionality Summary of `pdf_chat.py`

- **`get_openai_api_key()`**: Retrieves the OpenAI API key from environment variables.
- **`create_text_splitter()`**: Creates and configures a `CharacterTextSplitter` instance for chunking documents.
- **`process_text(text: str) -> Optional[FAISS]`**: Processes the input text by splitting it into chunks and creating a FAISS index.
- **`extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_reader: PdfReader) -> str`**: Extracts text content from a PDF file.
- **`open_pdf_file(pdf_file: Union[str, bytes])`**: A context manager for opening a PDF file, yielding a `PdfReader` instance.
- **`process_pdf(pdf_file: Union[str, bytes]) -> Optional[FAISS]`**: Processes a PDF file by extracting its text and creating a FAISS index.
- **`answer_question(knowledge_base: FAISS, query: str) -> Tuple[str, dict]`**: Generates an answer to a question based on the provided knowledge base.
