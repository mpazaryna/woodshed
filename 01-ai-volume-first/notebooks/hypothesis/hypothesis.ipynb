    "## Background on Hypothesis and Property-Based Testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Property-based testing is a testing technique that focuses on verifying the properties or behaviors of your code rather than specific input-output pairs. Instead of writing individual test cases, you define properties that should always hold true for your function or system, and the testing framework (in this case, Hypothesis) generates a wide range of inputs to test these properties.\n",
    "Hypothesis is a powerful Python library for property-based testing. Here's why you should consider using it:\n",
    "\n",
    "Thorough testing: Hypothesis generates a wide range of test cases, including edge cases that you might not think of manually.\n",
    "Reproducibility: When a test fails, Hypothesis provides the exact input that caused the failure, making it easier to debug.\n",
    "Shrinking: If a test fails, Hypothesis automatically tries to find the simplest possible input that still causes the failure.\n",
    "Integration with pytest: Hypothesis works seamlessly with pytest, making it easy to incorporate into existing test suites.\n",
    "Customizable strategies: You can define custom strategies for generating test data specific to your domain."
