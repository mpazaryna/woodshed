# Instructor Library for Python

The Instructor library simplifies working with structured outputs generated by large language models (LLMs). It provides tools for defining expected output formats, validating LLM responses, and managing interactions with various LLM providers.

## Key Features:

* **Structured Outputs:** Define the expected response format using Pydantic data models. This ensures consistency and reduces errors in processing LLM outputs.
* **Validation:** Validate LLM responses against the defined data model to ensure accuracy and catch potential issues.
* **Retry Management:** Configure retries for failed requests to the LLM, improving reliability in case of temporary errors.
* **Streaming Support:** Efficiently handle large list outputs and partial responses from LLMs.
* **Flexible Backends:** Works with different LLM providers beyond just OpenAI, offering flexibility in your LLM integration.

By leveraging Instructor, you can streamline the process of interacting with LLMs and ensure the quality and consistency of their structured outputs within your Python project.
