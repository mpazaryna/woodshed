Yoga is a physical, mental, and spiritual practice that originated in India over 5,000 years ago. The word "yoga" comes from the Sanskrit root "yuj," which means "to unite" or "to join." The practice of yoga aims to unite the body, mind, and spirit, and is often used as a tool for overall health, well-being, and self-awareness.

There are many different styles and forms of yoga, but most practices include some combination of physical postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama), and meditation. The physical postures, which are designed to promote flexibility, balance, and strength, are often held for several seconds to allow for deep relaxation and awareness.

Yoga is based on several key principles, including:

1. The Five Points of Yoga: These are the five main branches of yoga, which include:
	* Yamas (moral codes)
