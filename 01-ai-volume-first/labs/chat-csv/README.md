# CSV Reading

## About

This project utilizes a LangChain agent to provide an intelligent interface for querying CSV files. The agent is capable of understanding and answering questions about the data contained in CSV files, making it easier for users to extract insights without writing complex queries. By leveraging the power of language models and the structured approach of LangChain, this tool bridges the gap between natural language questions and data analysis.

## Usage

To use the CSV Chat CLI:

1. Ensure your environment is activated.
2. Run the script:
   ```
   python cli_chat_csv.py
   ```
3. When prompted, enter the path to your CSV file.
4. Ask questions about your CSV data.

## Logging

Warnings and errors are logged to a file in the `logs` directory.

Happy querying!
